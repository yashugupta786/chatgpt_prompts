uid_707203,You don't know your history and your ignorance is showing. Research why the judicial and parliamentary system elected to create CSIS in the first place. Canadians learned in the 70's why policing and intelligence activities need to be separate entities. Secret authority with little oversight is a recipe for surveillance over reach. It'd be illogical and blindly optimistic not to acknowledge this.What does this have to do with The US Border Agency and INS?

uid_267269,"The fields of Science are littered with the corpses of ""common sense"" ideas. UBI does not mean that there are more people or more houses. We already have a **massive** housing surplus... and yet prices have gone way up. And that's without any UBI at all. In other words, your assumption is too simplistic and is at odds with the empirical data about recent housing market behavior. Housing has been trending toward ""upscale"" properties for a long time even in the face of famously stagnant wages. You could just as easily say that low-end housing prices will either decrease or find a soft-cap since the lower end of the economy would be depending upon (read: *limited to*) their UBI... a landlord can put a sticker on his shithole, rat-infested apartment that says ""$100,000/yr"", but that doesn't mean he's going to get a tenant. It's far more likely that he's just waving around the price tag for the sake of marketing and fully intends to leave that unit empty while he decides what to do with it or until he can find someone who wants to buy that plot to demolish it to build a strip mall. Ultimately, the housing market must obey the supply and demand of its consumer base. Low end rents won't rise any higher than the lower end can afford (in which case... if they can afford it, what's the problem again?), and the upper middle segments will begin breaking even with the UBI in their taxes, so their housing won't increase either (because their net income won't change). And the upper end doesn't matter because their markets are not influenced by what millionaires *can afford*, they're governed by what millionaires *want to have*. But, again: *Who's to say that rent controls can't be put in place?* Especially considering how trivial they are to implement.Because rent control has been so awesome in places that have it."

uid_281388,"Why did you like Boogie Nights (1997)? I watched this movie last night, which I often heard as being a great, a classic, a must-watch and...maybe I didn't get it? I didn't think it was bad, I just don't honestly see why it was great. Burt Reynolds apparently gave an award-winning performance, but I don't see how it was better than Julianne Moore, Don Cheadle, or Philip Seymour Hoffman. I can't honestly say I was impressed with Mark Wahlberg in this movie either; all of the scenes where he tried to be tough just ended up making me wince a little. And I think I understand this movie's synthesis, it was showing the human element of people in the pornography business, and how mundane things like sex, drugs, and violence become in those spheres but why was this groundbreaking? Didn't Pulp Fiction do something remarkably similar (and arguably better) three years earlier? There were times when this movie felt to me like it stitched together all the parts of what a great gritty movie typically has, but the actual plot connecting those elements felt thin and insubstantial. The dialogue was awkward half the time and several moments that looked like they should've been meaningful never actually developed or *became* meaningful (you could say this makes the movie nihilistic, but again, why is that special?). And this isn't to say I didn't enjoy it at all. It had funny moments, a great soundtrack, some cool performances, interesting instances of camera-work. I just feel like I didn't enjoy it as much as I should have. So, I guess I feel like I missed something and I'd appreciate it if somebody could show me why this movie deserves more credit than I'm giving it.watched it for the name Dirk Diggler, left with Brock Landers."

Who has to deal with more is an asinine issue and shouldn't even be discussed by anyone out of grade school. Let's worry about what's wrong with the world and fix it.

It's bloodboiling that so many people are like ""yeah! this will help!"" No. Obviously nobody should be raping anybody but an article on facebook isn't going to cure a sick person who thinks that is okay.

uid_348800,"I've got some pretty strong anti-abortion convictions. How can I ""practice what I preach""? Let me explain... --- **Background:** I'm pretty strongly opposed to abortion. **(1)** I think human embryos and fetuses are 100% *human*. **(2)** I think when two adults have a child, they have taken responsibility for the life of that child. MOST abortions happen for reasons that these two beliefs strike down hard. Things like ""I'm too young/old"", ""I don't want people to know"", or ""I can't afford it"" are NOT acceptable excuses in my book. You did a grown-up thing. Accept the grown-up responsibility. There are a few cases where I'd at least be willing to *talk*... But these aren't very representative of most abortions. --- **However...** I recognize that *this is not easy and it should not be taken lightly*. Real people are in really difficult circumstances. I absolutely don't think we should harden our hearts to the issues people face and the realities of a broken world. We need *compassion* for everyone involved. And we need *practical solutions*, for everyone's sake. One of the biggest criticisms I hear directed at those against abortion is that we aren't being reasonable or that we don't care. To some extent, that's said by people who don't really know what they're talking about. But to some extent it's true. And I don't want to be part of the demographic that makes it true. --- **So what to do?** I think part of the solution is political. I think that anyone who opposes abortion should support things like better sex ed and access to contraceptives. So we can talk about solutions like this if you want. *But I'm looking for some practical ideas of what I can do.* I thought perhaps this might be a good community to ask. We've got people on both sides of the issue, but I think both sides generally *care*. Are there places to volunteer? Organizations to support? Conversations that need to be had? What do you guys think?Don't have an abortion."
uid_475085,"And then they can use **your** (taxpayer) money to fix the window, and find, prosecute, and jail the person responsible - all at your expense and accomplishing nothing.

uid_394796,"Is there any country which doesn't worship women in one way or another? Almost every country seems full of white knights who worship women, and in a way non-Western countries are often even worse than Western countries in this regard. In some countries if a man gets into an argument with a woman and upsets the woman, often loads of white knights will come to her defense and attack the guy to defend the woman's ""honour"". In fact, many non-Western nations are big on this idea that woman have a great sense of ""honour"", which is nothing but stupid white knighting, applying masculine values to women, women don't have ""honour"", they're not men. In many non-Western countries, the general cultural expectation is that a man should treat women with far more respect and consideration than he would treat another man. This definitely seems to be the case in countries like Russia and India, as well as most Asian countries really. The majority of men in almost all countries seem to treat women as if they are superior beings, it really is a delusion that affects the majority of men everywhere.Arab countries?"

He was forced off his throne by Galavan and his mother was killed in front of his eyes.. He found his father only for his step family to ruin everything for him.. Needless to say the guy is really emotional right now and seeks love and attention so he hasn't fully become the Penguin yet he has the walk and the umbrella and he's taken the name but he's still not the penguin in personality.. Ed is the only thing that Oswald has anymore and I speculate that Ed will hurt Oswald one day intentionally or non intentionally and this heartbreak will be the last straw for Oswald and he will start to shut everyone out and will become cold and more ruthless and that is when he will fully become the Penguin.If you're right about Ed intentionally hurting Oswald and thus that makes him more cold, and I do hope you are correct, I look forward to that day because one episode and I've already had enough of romantic softie Oswald."

Clicked Bitpay's ""Pay with Bitcoin"" link. Blockchain immediately opened, however the app sent .0843 BITS instead of .0843 BTC. I was really confused for a long time why the gift card was not appearing for me, it's because I barely sent them a few pennies worth of Bitcoin and I didn't even realize it for a long time.

So I hopped onto PS3 ghosts because infected is bae and I found a game 15 hours later. Now in this game was a user who goes by ""blakepurtle"". I played 5 matches without anything happening then I managed to get the last 2 kills on octane as an infected, this is when this guy started thinking I was a hacker. I'm a pretty bad player when it comes to cod so at first I took this as a compliment but then he became more annoying and idiotic. For one he would've seen if I had a mod menu because I had killed the last guy I had no mic to explain. I messaged him asking if he honestly thought I hacked and he said in his mic ""Yeh you fucking dick cunt."" At this point I'm laughing my ass off. Then the guy got an infected to block him in an area but I managed to ricochet a knife and kill him. This is when it got funnier. Next game starts and I die pretty early, I manage to kill him and then he says ""You fucking hacker cunt I'm gonna report you you dog."" I was too bored to explain that ghosts reporting is dead and I went on. He also said ""even though you hack I still survived longer"". Next game I go on a 12 streak as a survivor but then purtle killed me. He then says ""Yeh you fucking suck mate, I manage to kill you even though you hack faggot."" Next game he was first infected, he managed to kill 2 guys and then he said ""OI hacker, that's more kills you can get with no hacks on. I then by pure luck, get a kem (Basically a nuke if you haven't played ghosts). And then he says *Turn god mode off you hacking dick*.

To think that some ""True story"" not BASED ON but TRUE STORY that they somehow got the rights and military clearance to show, just sits wrong with me. I can't quite put my finger on why, but this sits with me the same way the Seal Team Six movie did, and not in a good way. Bad things happened with Benghazi, people did die, and something went wrong, but to try and put extra in there, things that apparently no one had ever seen or heard about before this movie, just smacks so badly of propaganda and attempts at blatant overhanded bias that I really question who thought it was a good idea to green light. And this isn't me just saying these things, these were actual taglines in the trailer. I just feel almost ""Bowling for Columbine"" bad over it because it feels like that was the only reason to make this movie, to try and force discussion. But unlike the aforementioned movie, it is trying to rehash things that have already been talked about and not start any new conversations.

uid_467436,"I see this 30% defense all the time and I don't think people realize that Burch wrote the main story for this game. There's a ton of quest dialogue, flavor text, and ambient dialogue that makes up a larger percentage of what constitutes the game. Any major story material was written by Burch, including all Vault Hunter dialogue, Jack, and main quest dialogue. He wrote Borderlands 2, they wouldn't just dump Jack's story rise in the hands of another writer. When you look at the story writing of BL1 it's also not very progressive. Burch definitely introduced it to the series. Whether or not a new writer continues the trend remains to be seen.Have a source?"

I put mine up for 300k to make a quick buck and still make a sizable profit, then some guy pms me after about an hour saying that im ""destroying the barding economy!""

I'd much rather have the release cycle happen the way it is than wait until what could be December or January for Apple to straighten all the kinks in both platforms and THEN release them. It would've been nice if they had them both ready sooner, but the same can be said with a lot of products and the phrase always comes to mind, ""It'll be ready when it's ready.""

uid_284694,"100% correct. If she's saying that participating in any cultural phenomenon that didn't entirely originate in your own family's society is cultural appropriation, then about 95% of anything we do, ever, including the vast majority of anything these extremists try to claim others shouldn't be doing or using or wearing or experiencing, are cultural appropriation on *their* part in the first place. In other words, either *everything* is cultural appropriation, or nothing is. The very nature of culture and society is that it borrows from others. Just like literature, nothing is totally original anymore. Or, more likely, if you are labeled as a member of a group that's not at the top of the privilege food chain, then cultural appropriation doesn't apply to you anyway. Because you can't do anything wrong if you don't have power in a certain society. That's how that works. I'm gonna rip my hair out.

PM was actually a really good buffer for Melee and Brawl, but for Smash 4 and Melee we don't quite have something like that. The best thing I can say is play both games and attend tournaments for both games. It's actually a really exciting time for Smash because both communities are actually coexisting in a really wonderful way. I feel like the Melee community has Smash 4's back and vice versa. So it's awesome to feel like I am part of both now. Go to tournaments for both games! For 64! PM! Melee! Brawl! Smash 4! All smash games.

This makes things much more exciting, but it also makes things much more emotionally charged. We would like to ask you to be cognizant about how you interact and post both here and in the opposition's sub. As playoffs often bring out the worst in some, we are changing some of our procedures during game day. Most of these will be behind the scenes, but there is an important one to mention. At some point during the game, we will likely be locking the subreddit so that no submissions can be made. We will still allow replies, however. If we win, it will be lifted not long after the game--maybe an hour or two. If we lose, it will stay locked longer until the glut of trolls diminish. You can help with all of this in two ways: 1. Report, report, report. If you see something posted that is trolling or posted to cause conflict, please report it. Even if it's borderline, we will review it and determine. We only have so many eyes and all your help will be huge on making things smooth. 2. Be proactive. Stay out of the opposition's sub. Nothing is gained by going there. Stay out of arguments that will flair up. We don't care if you disagree with someone and talk about it, but when it devolves into name calling and accusations, that is a problem. Contain yourself from getting out of hand so we don't have to. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to ask. Most importantly, have fun and let's get us another ring!

I said yes to everything because she's the doctor, but the tech came back and said, ""you know those wraps are $50 **each**, right?"" After I picked my jaw up off the floor, I decided I could get the same benefits from gauze and an ace bandage. I stopped using that vet, and my new vet has much more reasonable prices and treatment suggestions. TL;DR: sometimes it is the vet's fault.

The studies can be interesting when properly interpreted, but the authors almost always over-reach to draw exciting, ""evolutionary"" conclusions based on their study that isn't actually designed to test an evolutionary hypothesis. Their training is in psychology, not evolutionary biology.Thank you for that."

Christianity and Judaism were barbaric in the same ways, and in some places still are, but mostly have shifted to a less harmful version. Yes the Koran codifies a lot of horrible stuff that people now do in Allah's name. And the bible also codifies similar horrible stuff. But with the bible those parts mostly now get ignored. I don't know how much evil crap is in the Vedas, but Hinduism is barbaric and superstitious in rural India, and far less so among educated Hindus.drown everyone on the planet but one family #notbarbaric"

uid_686834,"Any tips for a frustrated returning player? I've always loved Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2, and I've gotten back into the sequel recently after a few months away from the series. The first game drastically lengthened my notoriously short fuse, but when I stopped playing, it eventually went back to being shorter than my shoelace. For the record, I don't wear shoes with laces. In an attempt to get back into DS2 and finally finish my first playthrough (Over a year after I bought the game, mind you), I made myself ingame (I'm currently wearing the Alva set with the Drangleic shield and a +5 Broadsword for reference). I managed to almost get to the Last Giant before my first death on the other side of the Cardinal Tower wall, trying to get the firebomb- chucking Hollow to blow up the powder barrels. I succeeded at getting shortcut open and proceeded onto the Ironclad knight (After dealing with Pate's little trap room with the Hollow ganksquad), where I got the other firebomb Hollows to blow him up. I couldn't get away in time, so I died again. At this point, I was slightly peeved at my ineptitude: Normally, I would take out the Hollows, then deal with the knight, but I had forgotten my own technique! I shrugged it off and kept going. When I got to the sword statue, I looted the Halberd with no intention of using it and slid off the ledge while trying to fight the Hollow who had snuck up on me. I yelled at the screen, ""WAIT! NO!"", which turned a few heads in my house. I think now would be a good time to mention that I am 17 years-old and living with my parents. That's going to be important later. I brushed that off and pressed on. After killing the Last Giant and Persuer with almost no effort and good dodging skills (And no, I didn't use the ballista), made my way to the Lost Bastille. I tracked down and took out the Lost Sinner and proceeded to hunt down the rest of the Old Ones. After losing 50, 000 souls in the Iron Keep (While taking out the Old Iron King as the third Old One), I gave up for a week. I was surprised that I hadn't ragequitted yet. The other day, I picked up the game again and took out the Old Iron King after dying a few more excrutuating times to the Ironclad and Alonne Knights. I I went to go take out the Duke's Dear Freja. That was when this story starts having a point. After freeing Rosabeth and opening the door to the Shaded Woods, I was ganked by those poison zombie bastards. After yelling an angry ""DAMMIT!"", I put on my gameface and pressed on. Several curse urns and a Najka bossfight later, I made my way to the cave filled with spiders. The spiders jumped at me, broke my poise, and were incredibly annoying. I ran away to use a lifegem only for the game to flat out not do what I told it to do. I yelled something along the lines of, ""DO IT! DO WHAT I'M TELLING YOU TO DO!"". The game didn't listen and I died. I slammed my fist on my controller in a small rage and for some reason, kept going, frowning a yelling about the smallest things. If an enemy hit me, I yelled for it to stop, died, and raged. If I died, I yelled, complained, and kept getting stressed out. Eventually I made it to Freja, when I totally blew up. The spiders blocked my escape from the boss's laser attack. I yelled, ""SPIDERS, GET OUT OF THE WAY!"" I died, punched my controller again, slammed it on the sofa, and stopped for the day at my Mom's order. I researched the fight that night. Cut to yesterday. I summoned Boyd to help me deal with the boss, and I killed it. After getting the last Great Soul, I made my way to Drangleic Castle. At this point, I am still using the Drangleic Shield and Broadsword. I tried to kill the soldiers at the gate only to be combo'd to death with the help of the Mastadons. I yelled some more and slammed my controller AGAIN. My Mom told me to stop and take a walk around the block. I told her no, put my gameface on and tried again. I almost got combo'd to death again, but managed to roll back to the bridge. I stopped to use a lifegem. A crossbow bolt shot my right in the face and I died. I snapped. I yelled and screamed about crossbows, and upon respawing, went into a rant. My mom turned to face me in her chair, but I didn't pay attention. My raving was stopped abruptly by my mom slamming her hands on her desk repeatedly, standing up, screaming at me, and tossing things across room. She stormed away to the kitchen to get a drink and calm her nerves. My dad came it and gave me a death glare. I got up and left the house in a hurry. I haven't even touched my console since, not even to turn it off. This is the culmination of all of my actions so far. My whole family is pissed off at me and my mom refuses to reply to anything I say beyond basic sentences. But I didn't come here for family help. It will all blow over eventually, I can deal with it. I need help with the game itself. I know that my attitude is the problem. Instead of trying to lengthen my fuse again, I'm trying to get through a notoriously difficult game with only a mind for progress. It's not about the fun anymore, it's about progress an getting to the next area. When I encounter resistance, whether it be a difficult boss or just an annoying room, and die, my temper flares up. Recently, I can only take about 2, maybe 3 deaths before I violently ragequit. I need to slow down and learn more patience, but I'm having a hard time dealing with the smallest amount of annoyance. Tips about the game itself or how to improve my attitude are all welcome. Also, what are some of your worst DS2 experiences? How did you all deal with it?Get gud"

""LC"" refers to the ""Lost Cause"" that it was for the Argentinian patriots to successfully win this undemocratic referendum and recover the Malvinas once and for all, as only the English settlers were allowed to take part. ""GZD"" might not be immediately obvious, but from the context it definitely stands for ""Gauchos Zero Determination"", an attempt to provoke the Argentinians by implying that their brave soldiers simply weren't trying hard enough when they died for their country in 1982.

It's also one thing providing CC to someone and another explaining what the changes would achieve. It shouldn't take someone replying ""why?"" for the information to be found out. It just gets on my nerves when certain trends are followed for the sake of it, rather than analysing what they achieve. For example, I have a small nose and contouring around it makes it look far smaller. Similarly, I see people going for heavy brows when it makes their face look unbalanced. I get that maybe the theory part of make up is left behind after people figure out what their face shape is from a magazine but it's really important to maintain especially if you're trying to encourage new subscribers to search and scour for old looks.It would get downvoted for witchcraft though."

There was ""the room we don't talk about"" - a fourth bedroom that could not physically be opened in a custom built house. Now, the main level is mostly fine but my wife and her sister's bedroom are in various levels of hoard. It's slowly getting to the point where we can't stay there with her grandkids because who the hell knows what our toddler will get into in the room she would sleep in. Why did I write this essay? My wife has slowly became an angry neat freak who is so distracted by our own (perfectly fine) house that any intimacy between us has been squashed under mounds of stress around unfolded blankets, dirty dishes, and toys left out.

uid_906402,"Is there really anything NFL teams can do to prevent off season knee ligament injuries? With the recent ACL injury to Dante Fowler JR and Jeff Fisher's comments that the Rams go to great lengths during the rookie mini camp to avoid injury, I started to think about the conundrum that is the off season knee ligament injury, if they are avoidable, freak accidents or caused by improper training. First, being a Jaguars' fan, there is history between Fisher and the team I love, but to be completely honest, his approach to the rookie mini camp seems like a good idea and I believe he was just being honest at his approach. Heck, I kind of wish Gus Bradley did the same. Dante is known for practicing with intensity, and I'm wondering if this could have been avoided if they just did a walk through. But was Fowler's knee ready to explode at any time? Couldn't it just happen during OTAs or training camp? There's no possible way to avoid it from happening, right? Yoga is for girls. Pilates is for vegans. Lynn Swann was obviously joking when he said he practiced ballet, right? It just seems to me with the huge investment of a first round pick, NFL teams would go to tremendous lengths to avoid something like this. Case studies, Sports science-type labs with wires hooked up to player's knees. Is any of this coachable? Do coaches that are known to go hard during training have a lower or higher injury rate? I want to know if coaches actually coach on how to avoid blowing your knee out when during simple non-contact drills. I want to know if NFL teams invest time and effort on the science of ligament prevention (if it even exists). I want to know if this is actually avoidable during the off season, then why the hell does it keep happening?I say we just take tackling out of the game completely, with all these concussions and ACL tears it's just too much negative exposure on the NFL's part"

We had a 3-day trip planned, and I let the kids sign up for their ideal rooming situations (assuming you followed the rule of filling an entire room of 6 people to a room at once). This kid signed up for a room with one other person, thinking they would get it to themselves. So, as stated in the rules of the trip, I split them up to fill up two other rooms that had 5 each.

He has said he isn't ruling out a presidential run in 4 years, so while it isn't guaranteed or likely, age will not be a factor in his decision since he will be in public office for at least 8 more years anyway.Fool me once...Who is to say he wouldn't just take another dive and endorse a corporate candidate?"

Yes, he's checked the power cord (which often wiggles loose on that model Dell monitors), even made sure it was plugged into the power strip on the floor and that the power strip was plugged into the wall. He even was proud to tell me he remembered the Super key + P command to set his display to Extended display! He was giddy to prove he's no fool when it comes to technology, and I'm proud my little tricks have rubbed off on a user for once! I make my way to his office and survey the scene. Yup, power cord is tight in the back of the monitor, power button light doesn't turn on, button's not stuck or anything... Yup, the power cord is plugged in securely to the power stri- I suppress a chuckle and click the power strip's power button to ""On"". Immediately the monitor springs to life.

With great pomp and ceremony, he left his home and went to the temple. He met with the head monk, who agreed to let him study kung fu at the temple. The rich man shaved his head and donned the robes and was led to a room containing a well and a barrel of water. The monk told him to slap the surface of the water with his palm until no water remained in the barrel. The rich man didn't understand, but did as he was told. He slapped the water with his palm and a little water splashed onto the floor. He repeated the slapping for what seemed like hours until no water remained. He found the monk and told him he had finished. The monk instructed him to fill the barrel again and repeat the task. This scene repeated for days. Eventually, the rich son stopped going to the monk and just refilled the barrel without being told. He grew angry. He suspected he was the butt of a cruel joke, and that the monks would never teach him kung fu but he knew that if he returned to his family having only slapped water he would be a laughingstock. Eventually, the seasons changed and the rich son returned home for the holiday feast. His family was so proud of him for studying kung fu, even though he was secretly ashamed that he had not received even one day's instruction. ""What kung fu did you learn? What did they teach you?"" his family asked, eagerly. ""They didn't teach me anything,"" he mumbled. ""Oh, you are so modest, tell us what they taught you!"" they urged. The man grew enraged. ""They didn't teach me anything!"" he shouted, as he slammed his palm on the table, breaking it in half.hard work pays off when you're mad?"

I left because my head assured me that it's nothing but rubbish, but my heart is still in there. I watch relief society when there is general conference and am deeply touched, but once they talk about the BoM I find myself getting a little angry inside. Because I am a christian and the whole idea of salvation in the Mormon church (especially as a woman) is just wrong. Every time things don't go so well in my life, I really have to hold myself back from going there. I have been to numerous churches and none have the same community, Sunday school, offers and are in it with the same heart.

uid_759660,"Friend got caught with drugs, taken backstage by security then released. We thought that was the end of it until TODAY... On Saturday night we were sitting around in a big circle in the middle of the venue and my friend took out a piece to smoke. Against our better judgement but whatever, 2 security guards saw and took the pipe but what we didn't know was our friend behind us was rearranging her purse at the time, which also just so happened to have her leftover shrooms in it which she planned on taking later that night. The security guards told her to come with them, and they led her backstage. While she was backstage she was handed off to a senior officer who apparently put her through a Scared Straight sort of routine - he showed her the various people awaiting conviction, some rapists who had tried taking advantage of rolling girls earlier that night, some sellers who apparently were going to serve some big time, etc. Then he took down her info, gave her a slap on the wrist, took her drugs and released her back into the festival. She joined us again and we celebrated the rest of the night. We were so thankful that that was all that happened to her, it could have been so much worse. FAST FORWARD TO TODAY and we find out a fourth security guard bribed one of the three other guards for her information and is now texting her asking for dates, sexual favors, etc. He has her phone number, name, address, everything she was made to believe security would keep private. What is the best course of action for this? yes she probably shouldn't have had drugs on her but this is fifty different shades of sketchy.Sue goldenvoice for lifetime passes to the festival"

uid_770756,"Me with my gf of 2 yrs. Should I be concerned with her ""sleeping"" with other people? My gf has slept in the same bed as other people, a few different times since we met. We've talked about it and I told her it makes me uncomfortable, but she continues to do it. She swears up and down that she has been faithful. She is Bi and has had gf's in the past, which I'm totally cool with, but she has slept with girls and guys since we started dating. Also she is co-dependent and hates to be alone, or stay alone. She just left me for a month to go back where we're from. Before she left, we discussed our boundaries in the relationship. She and I agreed that even cuddling and kissing other people are out of the question, since we are both faithful. So two nights after she got there, she had a lesbian couple over (mutual friends of ours) they had drinks till 4 am and all slept in her bed. Now she is going to a 3 day festival with the same girls. She tells me on the phone yesterday the girls are bringing their guy friend, and you guessed it, he and my gf are sharing a tent. Again she swears she has always been faithful and I have nothing to worry about, but she also knows it upsets me when we talked about it. I've asked her if I did the same thing, how it would make her feel, and she did not like the idea of me doing it. Which kind of pisses me off. Cake and eat it too? All in all, I do care about her a ton and want to stay with her if possible. I've believed most of what she tells me in our 2yrs together, however at times I want to leave the relationship, because of this stuff. I'm wondering if anyone has had a similar experience with someone they love? Also is this normal behavior for some people and should I just let it go? --- **tl;dr**: Gf of 2yrs. has ""slept"" with other people since we've been together and swears she has been faithful. I've told her it upsets me, but she continues to do it. Should I let it go or move on and leave her?She doesn't respect you for shit."

The dam had been opposed by the World Bank as being unnecessarily expensive compared to a cheaper alternative, but local politicians favoured the Misicuni project. An alternative, the Corani project, would have supplied water to Cochambamba from an existing dam. The high expected cost of the Misicuni project led to the 38% tariff increase imposed at the beginning of the concession. Had the advice of the World Bank been followed, the construction of the dam would not have been part of the concession, the tariff increase would have been unnecessary and Aguas del Tunari would have had to face competition in its drive to win the Cochabamba concession.[6] Such competition would have made it much more difficult to obtain some of the abusive conditions that were ultimately included in the concession.Yeah, it's the government's fault that a corporation bought the water rights and jacked up its price."

These men in power also crafted religion, politics, and media, and their strong hold only loosened in the last few decades. Red Pillers bitch all the time that women are helpless and unable to problem solve. They also base a lot of theory on women's indecisiveness and indirect communication styles. As a Feminist I posit that these traits are due to nurture, not nature, and they put us at a disadvantage in many social interactions, and in many fields. Having a well-established history of men as leaders/contributors to society and women as less capable home-makers and mothers has crafted the gender roles we have today, and that influences how we treat people.How is this any different from how weak men are treated?"

You could also see the difference depending on the different tracks, when you had a track where you had to be really neat and precise the girls were really up there with the fastest boys but when you came to a track where you really had to hustle the kart around they seemed to lose out.

(Palpatine) -Creating a dictatorship. (Palpatine) -Order 66 and the murder of countless jedi. (Palpatine) -Force choking and murdering employees for events that are at times out of their control. (Vader) -Attempting to kill a defenseless luke after he surrenders his weapon. (Palpatine) -Seizing control of cloud city despite their attempts to cooperate. (Vader) -Testing out a carbon freeze system on an unintended individual just to make sure it won't kill the intended one. (Vader) -Beginning a war against the Republic that will claim countless lives. (Palpatine, Dooku) -Scheming and indirectly attempting to murder a senator. (Dooku) -Influencing the creation of a Droid and clone army with the intention of the two to fight each other. (Palpatine) -Soliciting the services of bounty hunters to either assassinate or capture persons of interest. (Dooku, Vader) -Creating not one, but two super weapons capable of mass genocide in a mere moments time. (Palpatine) -Murdering an old friend while he was defending himself and after he turns his weapon off. (Vader) -Attempting to murder a family member, specifically a son, after he doesn't join the dark side. (Vader) -Killing a sith master on a impulsive decision after years of servitude. (Vader) -Murdering a sith master while he sleeps and is defenseless. (Palpatine) -Murdering a disarmed and defenseless sith apprentice. (Anakin, Vader) I guess if one disregards all these things and the ones I probably missed, the sith are pretty stand up characters.From my point of view the Jedi are evil."

From the start, this article implies some sort of superiority to the Yanomami culture. I would compare it to the naturalistic fallacy so popular among health nuts. Cultures may be more dominant, but the implication of an inherently superior one is disingenuous and intellectually lazy. As has been mentioned by many others, this man's bias towards his own culture is obvious. Having bridged the gap between Western and indigenous cultures myself, I prefer Western. I acknowledge and accept my bias. I also embrace my running, potable water, my general lack of illness, and access to all sorts of people and food. We can also acknowledge the pitfalls of Western society, but I think a more salient point is: why do we care what this man thinks? He can dislike or disagree with cultural mores, but that's his prerogative. Why should anyone have to cater to his worldview? Preservation of his own culture is a worthy and noble endeavor, but one doesn't need to vilify another to achieve it.You are dizzy from your merchandise and aeroplanes!"

So I open Team Fortress, turn off VSync and then.... Honestly couldn't tell a worthwhile difference. I then went to various comparison websites in case it was something weird with the game, and then I could see the difference side by side, but only just barely. It may be a case of it being more noticeable as you spend time with it, but for the time being, I am incredibly underwhelmed. Frankly, I'm kind of relieved though, as now my dream rig doesn't have to include a 144hz monitor, nor the graphics power to support it.

Edward does something offensive, then follows up by doing something super hammy. This makes the good people seem even better."" Example One: I was watching over my seven hundred adopted cats that I routinely take to old folks homes to act as stress reduction (don't worry I spend 80 hours a week cleaning up after then so Sweetie doesn't get sick) when suddenly Edward comes in and says that cats are dumb and kicks one. ""Don't kick the cat, Edward"", I say, when he slips and falls backwards from kicking the cat and can't get up because he is too fat. *filler dialogue* We bake a vegan super chocolate dessert with vanilla beans grown by blind Himalayan monks (PM me for the recipe) but sorry Edward is still with us. Example Two: When GoodPerson, NiceGuy and I were living in our mystery mansion full of exotic animals financed by an extremely wealthy but horribly sick mutual friend like some kind of bizarre mix of **Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends** and **X-Men**, we decided to have a party and invited the local sheriff, the town mayor, an elderly holocaust survivor, a native american throat singer, and a sociopath. Goodperson made the punch and put it in the fridge next to the unmarked jar of urine we keep on hand for testing Sickly's blood crystal urine content. Edward came out of his room and stomped his fat feet down the stairs and yelled at everyone a variety of racial and homophobic slurs. ""No Edward don't do that."" We said. He said that only queers have parties without punch. ""But we made punch, it is in the fridge."" we said. Edward stomped like a big fat fatso to the fridge and opened it, pulled the jar of urine out and drank it mistaking it for the punch ho ho what a jolly and unexpected twist. Edward threatened to sue us and screeched perched atop the kitchen counter for roughly 8 hours while the rest of us ate home-made pineapple upside down cake with a Hawaiian scotch and ethically sourced brown sugar glaze (PM me for the recipe). Edward is still a big fat fatty fat ham and we are all completely perfect, have time to do a zillion things in two days, know everyone from the local town dogcatcher to the president, but we don't have the spine to kick out an abusive wish-fulfillment caricature of a fat person.You should just submit this as a story."

Main weapon: Spike's main weapon is a charged based projectile. Holding left click causes spike to inhale and then release creating a ball of fire. The projectile increases in size and damage the longer you hold down the mouse. attacking enemies will refresh any fire effect on them for 2 seconds. Spewing goop: Spike spews goop for 3 seconds following the mouse and slowing all enemies hit. the goop can be ignited by your attacks causing all enemies to take damage over time. ( Think of this like amc's honey in smite you can drag it to create ay shape except you can ignite it for lots of tick based damage.) Cool down 18 seconds Firewall: Spike creates a giant wall of fire that augments all allied shots that go through it. Any alley shot that shoots through the wall will catch on fire and deal tick based damage to enemies hit.

But as the series has progressed more and more time has been spent on the single player, spending millions of the games budget on a single player element that most players will play once and then never again. Getting voice actors in and spending months creating set pieces and specific animations etc. Drop the pretence that it is anything other than a MP game and suddenly your entire budget can go towards improving the part of the game that people actually keep playing more than 2 days after they bought it. /rantBut Titanfall doesn't have any content!"
