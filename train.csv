uid_898070,"Conspiracy Theory on Marvel's civil wars We're now getting Civil War II and will soon get Inhumans vs X-Men. This follows on the heels of Avengers v X-Men, and ultimately the original Civil War. And that's just the headline events; hero-versus-hero fights have been, to a greater or lesser extent, a fixture of Marvel since the beginning of that universe, and (at least recently) it's been less a matter of ""fight and then team up against the villain that set you up to fight"" and more straight-up hero against hero, until only one is left standing. DC generally reserves *that* for Elseworlds. And that gives rise to an idea. Who gains from those heroic civil wars? The villains, for one, at least those whose goals are something besides revenge or profit. But also the government. What happens if you don't have inter-hero conflict, if the heroes stand as a united front against evil? You get the Justice League, in one of its bigger incarnations. And the DCU government, to a great extent, has exactly as much power as the League allows it to have. When push comes to shove, a united superhumanity is sufficient to overthrow the government if necessary - and because of that, it will never become necessary. Power ultimately lies with the League. So what do you do to save democracy, if you're its SHIELD? You need to, simply put, prevent the Trinity or an equivalent from forming as unbreakable friends and leaders. And so you provoke civil war after civil war, aiming to splinter the superheroic community. Aiming to engineer long-lasting mass hatred towards only limited sections of that community - those with the X-gene, say - to make it clear that they're not all the same. And you need to do this entirely in secret. Because, if you don't, and the villains don't win, a Justice League equivalent will form; and if it does, sooner or later democracy will die. (Superman's response, aside from pointing out the hypocrisy? That, first of all, a republic being the optimal form of government is theorem, not axiom, and a theorem derived from axioms some of which superhumans violate. But also that the Justice League is, yes, only a metastable equilibrium. But that this centralized superhuman bloc is desirable precisely for that reason. The goal is to lead humanity into the light, but equality must not be reached by making everyone mortal, but by making everyone divine. By making everyone super, not by making no one super - and yes, those are two quite different things.)What the hell are you talking about",0

Currently we are still getting the code straightened out but that should be wrapped up by the end of the week. **Locations:** On Friday we are going to be heading to Up Down cigars(1550 N Wells St, Chicago IL 60610). This was our Friday location last year, and Phil has kindly agreed to have us back this year. Our special guest for the evening is going to be Omar from Fratello! On Saturday we will of course be heading to Casa De Montecristo(1332 W 55th St, Countryside IL 60525). We are looking to have several of our favorite reps returning and we will be doing a silent auction this year along with the traditional raffle. We are still trying to iron out times and prices for tickets but we will have that information for you soon. If you have any questions, please post them below and I will do my best to answer them.I only have one question Jim,and frankly I find it very important, as it was the icing on the cake of the 2015 meetup and the deciding factor if I'll be heading to the meetup in 2017 - Q: ""Will we be heading back to that sleezy hotel bar (or any sleezy dive bar) post-Casa to get wacked and witness some chick (or possibly the same chick) give some rando a public handy?""",3

It is also fairly roomy inside, with the ELX I think it has an interior on par with an Acura. Let's hear what hybrid you guys think is the best bargain? Or is there a diesel that is better?My favorite hybrid would be a toss up between the mclaren p1 and LaFerrari.",5

Yet the British Empire hung on, ebbing and flowing, but overall in decline, until after WWII. I'd say the beginning of the fall of the US empire was in the early 1970s. That's when the purchasing power of the American people peaked, and that's when the US, so bankrupt from the debt of the war on Vietnam, had to detach the US dollar from the gold standard. Though we've ebbed and flowed since then, US economic power has been in pretty much continual decline, Reagan's trade policies turning us into a debtor country in the 1980s, and only the power vacuum of the breakup of the USSR making the US seem hyper-powerful. The exact end may indeed be quite quick, especially since we've been in decline for so long.

So, I stopped at a convience store on my way to work this morning with a friend, and, unfortunately, ran into this really annoying TBM I did not want to talk with at the time. To make a long story short, this guy is nice, but he's super annoying because he is always asking church-related questions every time I see him. As I waited in line when we were talking, I ordered a large coffee (and tea for my friend). I wish I could have taken a picture of this TBM's face when I paid for and received my coffee. He was visibly disturbed (but was trying to act like it did not bother him). He was almost acting like I had kissed the girl he secretly liked but did not want to show he was disturbed by it. I was glowing, smiling, and just enjoying my morning/coffee. It is simply amazing that some TBMs are so worried about meaningless shit like drinking coffee. Out of everything we can worry about in the world, this guy was focused on what I was drinking with my breakfast; and to make matters worse, he was visibly offended by it.The part of this story that offends me the most is convenience store coffee.",18

I'm not sure the size of the party, but sizable, and supposedly everyone is sleeping there including my girlfriend and I. My worries are guys hitting on her and how to deal with it. Never been in that situation really, I would like to think I'd handle it maturely and she'd probably just tell them she's with me as I'd probably be standing right there with her. We talked about my insecurity about that (I know, not sexy) but I just said like ""I know you love me but I just have anxiety about these things"" she just said ""Just keep being awesome and you won't have to worry"" jokingly. She just says stuff like it won't happen and it never does. Her and I typically blend in and are fairly shy but still a worry of mine. My other concern is the sleeping arrangement, I have this fear we will all be sleeping on top of each other and it'll be super uncomfortable. I asked what we were doing she said if I don't drink we could just go back to her house and sleep there but she doesn't want to do that and that being the answers to all my fears, I'm still not going to be selfish and ruin a party she wants to be apart of. Come sunday, we will be cuddling and relaxing so I guess I have that to look forward to. All in all, I am 90% sure I will have a good time. Its just these stupid fears that aren't guaranteed to happen that surface in the coming days leading up to these things and then I'm miserable leading up to it.

uid_447176,"Umm.... Send me your ATM receipt, please? I posted this on Craigslist but I don't know how much action the DSM craigslist gets. I don't know if it's ok to post this here, as I'm not a reddit user, so I understand if this gets flagged (a co-worker recommended trying it, though). I'm planning an insanely elaborate scavenger hunt -- the kind where you follow a bunch of clues and run around the city (Chicago in this instance). It's for my friend who is currently living in Des Moines. One of my clues will lead to an ATM machine, and part of the ""clue package"" or whatnot will be an ATM receipt from the bank she uses. In this case, West Bank -- specifically, the Urbandale branch. There are a bunch of online services that will let you create fake ATM receipts (mostly as a way to impress ladies in bars). But I want it to look as authentic as possible, because I want her to think it's hers. And to do that I need to actually see what a West Bank ATM receipt looks like. Unfortunately, you can't find those outside of the Des Moines metro. I can't ask the friend, because the scavenger hunt is a surprise and I can't think of a plausible excuse for asking her. I don't really know anyone else living there. So what I need is someone who is a West Bank customer to hit a West Bank ATM and send me a picture of the front and the back of your receipt. Obviously - OBVIOUSLY - black out/obscure your personal information(!!!) I'm just interested in the layout of the receipt so that I can create a template from it using PhotoShop. The Urbandale branch is preferable, but really any branch is fine -- all that really matters is that you're a West Bank customer (as some banks print them out differently for customers) and that it's an actual WB terminal, not some grocery store ATM using a West Bank card. (I swear this isn't part of some elaborate fraud. I'm not sure what fraud you could commit with an ATM receipt, seeing as how people usually toss them into the trash or on the floor right next to the machine. So if I really wanted to commit some crime, I guess I could go pull them out of the trash cans next to gas station ATMs.) ANYWAY - for people's troubles I'm willing to pay $20!You want me to send the receipt to Nigeria?",6

One day, GM was taking care of my mother's dog and cat (who had the misfortune of being named Dickens -- not all that bad except she always called him Dick. Dick the cat.) Anyway, GM was taking care of the pets, and let the dog out. The cat managed to sneak out because, well, an 83-year-old woman isn't able to catch anything moving at any level of speed whatsoever. It was January. In Cleveland. My mother refused to look for it. A week later their neighbor found the cat frozen solid behind her trash cans. Mom told everyone the cat ""died of liver problems.""

If you are working in an office and you are the only black guy, and everyone keeps making racist comments about black people, would it not be actually appropriate to believe that your work might not be judged appropriately in such an environment? Would it actually be right to be offended, and shouldn't the boss do something to prevent that? If a woman is trying to go about her business, walking down the road, and men are yelling obscene things at her, shouldn't she have the right not to have to deal with that? Fuck, as a guy if I'm sitting on a bus and a random stranger sits besides me and starts talking to me, I feel like they are invading my space. I'm annoyed as hell. Wouldn't the correct attitude be that people should not have the right to take away your personal time? While I totally agree that ""thick skins"" should be necessary, and I do see over reactions all the god-damn time, I think ""offensive language"" and ideas actually do more harm than this video suggests. Offensives ideas spread and infect minds, and those ideas legitimately affect how people act. I'm not arguing we should censor such speech, but I am asking the question, isn't there a line where ""the right to not be offended"" should be a thing? At the point where offensive ideas actually get in the way of people's ability to live their lives normally?Just a joke bro!",3

uid_279438,"Okay... I'm going to wade into this. Feel free to disagree, but I'm going to try and lay some things out for those who don't see what the issue is. I grew up with the original trilogy. I saw ROTJ before puberty, and my friends and I were mesmerized by Leia. There was the one kid who insisted that his cousin had a Kenner Slave Leia action figure. Dammit, I wanted that figure too! (For those of you who don't know, there wasn't one. It was just myth until the 90s.) So, Slave Leia became a thing. The Friends episode from the 90s actually captured some of the allure of this outfit. But then I had to go ruin it all by having kids. Yup, I have daughters, and a lot of this slave Leia stuff bothers me. Part of the problem is that by focusing on this outfit, it undercuts Leia's agency in the film. In ROTJ, she puts her life on the line to save her boyfriend's life, gets captured, but then strangles the slimy dude who captured her. Take that. Leia's a badass. But look at this card? Do we get agency? Do we get a badass? Nope, we get submission. She's looking down, she's chained. We don't get Leia the ass-kicker, we get Leia lounging and showing off her body. And Topps is tellings us that Leia, posed thusly, will ""capture our attention."" But I do acknowledge that this scene happened, and does indeed make sense in the context of the story. My preference? Skip this card. Maybe acknowledge the outfit by using a shot where she is *doing something*. Strangling Jabba, shooting the sail barge gun, or even swinging to safety again. The real problem is what this outfit has become, outside of the movie. Go google ""slave leia art"" or ""slave leia fan art."" Umm... wow. Those images do not convey the picture of a leader, of a woman who went to save her boyfriend who got his ass frozen and hung on the wall in some backwater in the outer rim of the galaxy. That is a woman who exists to fuel our fantasies. That is my problem with this card, it hews too close to that Leia, rather than the badass that she could be. I'm not upset, but I'm not pulling this card. That's all. I just wanted to give you guys some context why people might have a problem with it.Honestly, if you don't see an image of a woman chained up like a dog, forced to wear a metal bikini while a pervert drools over her empowering, that sounds like a personal problem.",6

Remember one of these people who are frustrated about Hero League or Team League? Just downvote this f* noob because we have the power to judge him. Or this person who does NOT play the build you play with your fav. chara. Just downvote him, because it makes more sense to disagree with a silent treatment instead talking this out and allow new insights. Or that person, who disagree with a 'pro' because he can tell how bad he plays a character. Ditto goes for the tierlists. Your individuality is worthless as long as you are not a well-known person. Many known people in the scene exploit this on purpose because they're on a pro team or have to say something. This makes their opinion automatically better than yours. But you, you don't deserve anything. Open your mouth and we will downvote you unless you make a very good post - but still, it doesn't matter. I will downvote you just for the sake of disagreement that you ever thought in this direction. My personal suggestion would be to lay down and not try to understand this mentality. You cannot change people, they will never try to understand you and of course never change as long you're not on the top of the food chain.

Yes, the way the narrative is moving seems to set that storyline up. But think about Snake Eater for a second. Think about the way the entire world thinks about and knows The Boss. According to them she's a traitor. But we were there, and are privy to a whole lot more than everyone else. We know she's no traitor, we know what a true hero she was. Now consider what we know about Snake vs what we know of Big Boss from the pre - Snake Eater games. Perhaps the cycle repeats itself, and Big Boss gets painted with the same brush. After MGS V ends, we realize that our guy, our hero for over ten years (in our time) was never the villain that he was made out to be, or that everyone is expecting him to become in this game. And only we know it. For the rest of his life/the series, he will be considered a monster, but that's just his lot in life. And yes I know that would mean some re imagining of things from the old MG games, but Kojima loves to retcon, and i dont think he'd hesitate to do so with games that are 25 years old.

uid_24858,"The electors in the electoral college vote according to whom they have pledged to vote for: determined by the popular vote in either their state or congressional district (in Nebraska and Maine) Statements like this reek of complete ignorance of how elections actually work in this country. Here's how the electoral college works: The people vote. The vote in each district are tallied up and a winner of each district and/or state is determined. Depending on the state either the overall winner of that state gets all of that state's electoral votes, or the votes are split between candidates based on how many districts each of them won + 2 electoral votes determined by a statewide election (this is only done in Nebraska and Maine). The president-elect is the candidate that wins the absolute majority of electoral votes (currently 270). If no candidate wins a majority of the votes, the president is selected from the top-three candidates by the house, and the VP is selected from the top-three VP candidates by the senate. The house has selected the president twice: once in 1801, and once in 1825. The senate has selected the VP once in 1837. If the House is deadlocked and unable to make a selection, the VP becomes acting president until they are able to do so. If Senate is similarly unable to select a VP, the Speaker of the House becomes acting president according to the order of succession until a president or vice president is selected. This has never occurred. It is illegal in 24 states for an elector to either vote against their pledge or to not vote. These are called faithless electors and have *never changed a presidential election in US history*. tl;dr When you vote for president, you are voting not for the president, but for an elector that has pledged to vote for the particular candidate you think you've voted for. If the popular vote didn't matter, presidential candidates wouldn't spend billions of dollars campaigning publicly. Is the electoral college a perfect solution? Not really, but keep in mind the electoral college going against the popular vote is exceedingly rare.Totally simple!",3

uid_324727,"What's flawed is your thinking that ""I'll only have 5 channels"". Bullshit. You're right back to circa pre-1980s TV where there are only a handful of channels in existence. You *will* pick more channels, and you're cable bill will end up being considerably higher than if everything was just bundled. How cheap can ala pricing *possibly* be per channel? These companies aren't going to do consumers any favors. They'll charge a per-channel cost that benefits them, not us. If an average cable bill is now $75/mo, all they have to do is charge $3 to 6 per channel with ala carte and most people would have *higher* bills, not lower. The average household is 3-4 people. If each person picks just 5 channels (which again, I find ridiculously low), and they are each priced at $3-6/channel then you're right back where you were before with monthly bills at least as high as before. And if you're OK with more niche channels falling by the way side, then don't complain when all sitcoms, all news shows, all reality TV shows start looking the same. That is exactly what will happen because shows will have to constantly aim at the lowest common denominator viewer. You like science shows? Well forget that. Everything will get dumbed-down for an audience that has a 6th grade level of science understanding. You like movies? Well only expect the most mainstream of movies to be shown. You'll turn TV into what radio has become... brainless repeating of the same 1/2 dozen ""hit"" songs.Yeah it was a real mistake back when they introduced a la carte radio pricing which is the thing that caused modern pop music to be repetitive.",4

uid_987215,"I didn't think I was until a few weeks ago. I played a hunter back in Vanilla and BC and swapped to Mage in the middle of BC. My Mage's name was Bausfight and my Hunter was named Kyudo until I changed it to Minibaus. My Mage became my main up until the middle of Pandaria. I LOVED my Mage. He was just fun to play. And I loved his name as well. Couldn't get enough of my Mage. But I never considered myself ""attached"" to him because I had many, MANY alts. However, I swapped to a Windwalker Monk about halfway through Pandaria and he became my main. The class was INCREDIBLY fun to play. Even Brewmaster tanking was a lot of fun. During MoP I decided to swap servers. My Monk was the first to go and I decided to name him Bausfight since he was main now. Slowly but surely I swapped all of my guys over to the new server, everybody keeping their names (priest named Sidequest - white cow druid named Crazygloo - Hunter still named Minibaus - Rogue named Faeus... nothing funky for the the Rogue... sorry... - and the rest of them too). However, when it came time to switch my Mage over, I had to think of a new name. I came up with Abracadavra. So I kept leveling up my alts one by one to 100. My Mage was the last one that I had swapped and gotten to 100 which was a few weeks ago. The whole time leveling and gearing I was having a blast! I had forgotten how fun it was to play my Mage! But it also felt... off... Doing the dailies on my alts and then logging in on my Monk with the name Bausfight and then my Mage... it didn't feel right... Then as I got my gear and relearning how to play my Mage, I finally snapped and was like, ""NOPE! That's it! Sorry Monk... you're great and all, but my MAGE is the one and only Bausfight!"" So a quick name swap and my Mage is once again my main with the name Bausfight. And my Panda Monk has resided to the name Yenji. Those few weeks of playing my mage and having another character have his name made me realize how much I love the Mage class and that no matter what, even with a little slight detour, my Mage will always be my main. He's the Baus. And always will be. #magemasterraceYou are the reason Blizz won't discount character services.",4

uid_771779,"""Reliance on militias that are outside of the immediate command and control of the regime implies a withering, not a strengthening, of the regime"" - Samer Abboud I thought I'd share this section of Samer Abboud's book ""Syria"" that I found insightful. p 112: The local (loyalist) Syrian militais have played a pivotal role during the conflict. Although they operate with relative autonomy from the regime their participation in fighting rebel units has reduced the burdon on the increasingly emasculated SAA. Indeed, four years after the conflict began, it is clear that the regime would not have survived and maintained control over large parts of the country without the active participation of militias. Yet, the presence and reliance on militais obfuscates the regime's actual control over the country. The presence of militias throughout the country and the absence of rebel groups in those territories actually reflects the regime's weakness, for its reliance on decntralized, privatized violence has dispersed decision-making power to centers potentially outside of the regime's control. As the SAA contracts further, the army is forced to engage in miltary attacks alongside local and regional militias. Such reliance on militias that are outside of the immediate command and control of the regime implies a withering, not a strengthening, of the regime. 116 - The Syrian regime has been forced to rely on privatized and civilianized forms of violence to maintain its military capabilities and its ability to hold contested territory. The SAA has been gutted of personnel, with defections rampant and many syrians avoiding being conscripted at all costs. During the conflict, more than 40,000 SAA fighers are believed to have lost their lives and many regime loyalists from across Syria's sectarian mosaic have begun to openly question and challenge the utility of sending soldiers to their deaths. Such discord among loyalists has been a sensitive issue in Syria and has placed tremendous pressure on the regime. The combination of low military morale, rampant defections, loyalist discord about rising deaths, disintegration within its ranks, and mistrust among SAA soldiers have all forced the regime to turn to civilian or non-Syrian violent actors. ... Throughout Syria, The NDF elite are emerging as a conglomeration of warlords with their own agendas and interests that may or may not coincide with those of the Assad regime in the future. 117 - The phenomenon of warlords is not exclusive to the non-regime areas. The emergence of warlords and this particular architecture of violence in Syria has contributed to the regime's withering and their loss of decision-making power during the course of the conflict.In the short term it's strengthening the regime but in the long term, it really is weakening it.",6

Though some still like to claim GGers still believe there where. It only demonstrates that some people are stuck in the initial situation. Nathan still pushed and wrote about ZQ several times without disclosing their friendship. Something that obviously is up for debate but from the view of proper journalism, no. From that view there is no debate. At the very least he should disclosed his friendship. Worth noting is that Nathan G. have done this not only with ZQ but also with others on quite a few occasions. Something that wasn't known at the start but goes to show that there really where a reason to looking into it. But there are so much more crap but it isn't related to the start. But I do think that some peoples obsessiveness of female victims and harassment do severely diminish their capability to see what has been going on.

So instead, I was able to discover that we can weight certain scores differently depending on the running total. So now, pitching 8IP will net the same extra +3 that a W would have (extra 1.5 for 7th and 8th IP each). Similarly allowing 6 ER will net the same extra -3 that a L would have (extra -1 for 4th/5th/6th ER allowed). Relief pitchers needed some balancing as well, as the pitchers that were entering in tie games were not being properly rewarded/penalized for their performance, hence the relief wins/losses built to mirror the holds/blown saves.

uid_670852,"Removing recipes, best practices? Is it best to just use Minetweaker to remove recipes and items from a mod-pack even if some of the mods have options to disable their recipes in their config file? For example, I want to use Quark's recipe for Blocks of Charcoal, therefor I want to remove Actually Additions' recipe for the same. AA has a config setting that allows me to do just that but I'm already using Crafttweaker to remove and alter recipes from other mods. It seems like it would be best to keep it all in one place, but maybe from a performance standpoint it would be better to do it in the configs when possible. Am I just splitting hairs?My philosophy has always been that if a config option is provided for it, use that before resorting to a workaround (Minetweaker counts as a 'workaround') This is because there might be other things that the mod does/depends on when the recipe is enabled/disabled via its config, and using Minetweaker or other mods to disable a recipe might not fully/properly disable it.",8

People in movies smoked, there were smoking ""role models"" and it was the ""cool thing"" to do. When the first reports of the dangers of smoking came out there were huge arguments from people that smoked. ""You can't tell me what to do with my body"" ""I'm not hurting anybody but myself"" etc..... Over time more and more of the medical issues were accepted as fact and slowly the number of people smoking went down although typically the changes were forced by forcing smokers to another room or more recently outside. The only problem is that as the next generations grew up they typically had the first 10-13 years of ""not smoking"" even if their parents did as an opportunity to break the cycle. With obesity kids of obese parents never have that chance so how do you break the cycle ?except we cant really tell people to step outside when they want to be fat.",8

Note : This post is aimed at those of us who have hammered the game and have mostly everything, done both raids from launch and are now at a loss as to whether or not grinding things like Prison are worth it. If it doesn't apply to you and you're a new player, please enjoy the content and go nuts :D A few people have said Prison of Elders is useless, I totally agree at this point. You're burning for the meh Prison weapons with elements, and etheric lights or ciphers. Almost everyone has the ciphers done and dusted, and enough etheric light to boost all your gear you wanted. So, what now? We already know in Year Two that your 365 weapons will have a purpose at the start of the content, but as it progresses they'll lose their usefulness (I've always imagined 365 means it's effective against level 36 enemies just like 300 was effective against 30 enemies but that could be me talking shit). Anyway, these are things we need to know.. Etheric Light - What purpose will it have? Is there any point in me burning Prison for more? I've got 12 right now and all 3 of my characters have maxed VoG armour and Crota, all the weapons I want are 365. So, are these going to grant a purpose or should I just leave Prison as it is now? Exotic shards - Attack upgrades are no more, we know that. So, what use is the shard? I'd presume it'll be to Ascend them to Year Two status as that may just be a thing, but some of us are sat on 50+ shards? Weapon Cores &amp; Armour Cores - I don't know anyone who's not swimming in Weapon Cores at the least. Armour, less, but still a few. So, what purpose could these serve? The weapons have rotated fully now and armour as well, so what can I do with the 12 weapon cores I have? Crux of Crota - This still drops even if you've had it and Nechro'd your Ally. So, could it once again serve a use as a consumable in the Dreadnaught? We're back in Hive territory so I don't see why Oryx' weapons couldn't use the Crux of Crota or it could become relevant? That way, Crota's End becomes relevant once more and people have a reason to run it.As far as weapon cores go, I believe the weapon you buy from Variks dismantles into a mote and some weapon parts, so worst case we have that conversion path available to us.",1

So the pitch from Blizzard, when talking about Yogg Saron, was that he was a fun card, if not a competitive one (although he has indeed ended up being modestly competitive). Sometimes he would totally win the game, and sometimes he would fizzle out, but either way, you get a story out of it! Clearly some people agree with this, but I do not. I have played Yogg decks, and when I get one that wipes the board then plays Call of the Wild for me while refilling my hand, I don't feel ""Yes! Haha, what a crazy Yogg!"" Instead, I feel more like ""Sorry, opponent, the RNG just happened to favor me. Not your fault."" Conversely, I hate when a person plays Yogg against me and just hopes it happens to solve their problems. Does anyone else feel this way at all? I don't enjoy the crazy, uncontrollable swings that Yogg creates, even when they're in my favor. It doesn't feel like I'm winning (or losing) with intelligent, strategic thinking.Yeah I hate this RNG moments, another one I hate is the one the opponents gets better cards out of his initial hands than yours.",-1

I should probably back story this a little. Gem has a medical condition that she could easily walk into the doctor and get any type of medication she wanted. It doesn't cause pain normally, but it can, and because of that she can get pain medication also. She has full medical from FIL military service, and something from social security because of her condition. She doesn't work, doesn't volunteer or anything, FIL is retired, but she has ""no time"" to go to the doctor. She isn't an addict or anything, and as far as I know is in legit pain. And to current times- FIL called me at 10:30 last night for Gem. ""Gem needs to know if you have a few pain pills she can have."" No. No I don't. She needs to go to the doctor, and I'm not a pharmacy. Yes I know it is NYE, sorry, I do feel for her.

I'm 5ft 3"" and back then, I weighed only about 7 stone. I was where the mosh pit should be, if it didn't actually stretch all the way to the back wall. I'd got some tall blokes around me (all strangers) and it got so packed that I was lifted off my feet by the force of it. I was only upright, because I was wedged against those lads. Second song in, it was a big hit at the time and so the place went wild. The lad next to me stumbled and that gave me enough space to go under. There was no room to get me out. People fell on top of people on top of people. It went so dark and too warm. I couldn't breathe, but it was ok. That's something which has always been so weird about this. I almost miss it. My body must have been flooded with all the adrenaline, endorphins and whatever else activates, when the flight or fight kicks in, but there's nothing you can do. I was in the most serene, beautiful place, with no pain at all. There was no sense of time down there. I could have been there for seconds or hours. I knew the moment when bodies were lifted off me enough to allow me to gasp in red hot air. But that was more or less all. I was fine. I was totally fine. Like I said, I half miss being down there. I could hear this woman screaming. You know that tone and desperation that makes you want to just drop everything, in order to rush and save them? Her scream was like that. I couldn't do anything to help her. My face was clear, but the rest of my body was still trapped under several others (a witness later said there were at least nine with me on the bottom). All I could do was lie there, hearing the pitch of her panic and willing the lads around us to forget me - I'm fine - just get her the fuck out! Seconds, hours, a lifetime later, two fingers pressed under my chin. I don't know how the sweet proverbial he did it, but a bloke lifted me enough WITH HIS TWO FINGERS in order to grab my head and yank me free that way.

On one of my applications there is a box to check for the question: ""Do you consider your transcript(s) of university-level work an accurate indication of your academic ability?"" Is it a HUGE can of worms to open, if you click no? There is a box that opens if you click no, so I could explain, but here's my issue- I do not totally think my transcripts reflect my academic ability (does anyone?), as in one university I have attended (in Norway) the grades are comprised of only the exam results (the papers, presentations etc. are not counted in the final grade). At the other uni I've been at (in the UK) the grade is 2/3 exam, and the other third split between a single paper and a short mid-semester test. I am not a good test-taker, and the grades for all of my key areas are B's (a few As and one C in others), although each of my key area essays (except one) has gotten an A. I'm applying to universities in the US and Canada, and I'm not betting the admissions committees in my department will bother to read the whole ""description of education"" pages of my transcripts, and I'm not even sure they explain the actual ways the grade is composed. Would it be acceptable to explain all of that? I'm worried that, if I said all of my papers got A's when there is no documentation of this, and my references don't know this as the marking is anonymous, it would seem like I'm lying. And I'm worried that saying I'm not a good test-taker would just sound like complaining. And marking yes or no is so definitive- I wish there was a *maybe* option!I wonder if maybe a question like that is just there to give people a chance to explain any red flags on their transcript.",3

I also don't need to improve my defense since a) I don't rat and b) last time I witnessed a blops drop we killed a tengu and a sin, BUT there is no other mechanic in the game (to my knowledge) that allows for being a threat and not being at ANY risk (literally can be afk) whatsoever. Also, realistically at this point in the eve universe, any dedicated PvPer can just have multiple afk cloakers without it being a big deal to maintain and thus it's a growing pain.

uid_305677,"Afterbirth Imbalances I just sort of want to rant about this as I've been thinking it more and more as I play the game I really enjoy the game, I'm so very close to 1001% completion (just 3 keeper things and items to find) but ever since Afterbirth came out I can't help but notice how poorly balanced some aspects of the game have become I'm going to start with something that is debatably down to personal opinion, but the blue worm spawners are just bullshit, they are incredibly tanky, the things they generate are incredibly tanky AND charge you down, they spawn them at the same rate the others spawn flies (an enemy that will take at most 2 hits to kil as opposed to like 7 or 8), they move about avoiding you and then when you finally kill it there's a very good chance 1 or 2 more of the blue things will spawn. Now you're in a room with 4 of them, they've all spawned one worm, this room will now take you around 48 tears (that land!) to clear assuming they don't spawn any more worms (which they will). Bad enough, right? Oh but wait, you're in one of those rooms that is just a square ring with 1 of them in each corner, the 2 on your side spawn 1 each which both them charge at you. Guess what! Literally nothing you can do! You can't run away because there's nowhere to run! Now they're both running into you, you're losing health, and you still can't do shit about it because the room hasn't magically changed, and now those bastards are shooting out more worms. I fucking hate them. Moving on, Krampus, he can now spin his lil brimstone bullshit, wonderful. This wouldn't be an issue if it weren't for the fact that if he ends up against a wall, you can't fucking avoid it, he spins, you move with it, oh wait there's a wall in your way and now you've been hit by his laser, literally nothing you can do about it. The Forsaken who has this same function will move into the middle of the room before doing this so you can actually avoid it (unless you're in an L room which is another pile of bullshit) but this was clearly not actually given any thought with Krampus who someone just slapped the buff button on. Small rooms. Or thin rooms. Any room that funnels. Here's a boss that flings bombs that leave creep. Oh look he's spamming his creep explosion. You're now completely locked in and all it took was the first bomb! The second one just landed straight on you! Literally nothing you can do about it. Or here's 2 Monstros in the tiniest room, have fun. Now you're on the chest and you're in a corridor and here's 6 Monstros! They're all just hopping over to you so there's no room to dodge! All such fun! PHD! Basically useless. All those 'neutral' pills that are actually hugely detrimental don't get removed. Sure you don't get the stat downs, but when the alternative is a pill that means you can have both curse of the lost and curse of the maze on a giant dark room layout, I don't think that's smart. Sure, you can avoid it now (if you can remember the ??? doesn't mean you don't know what the pill is) but why is it still in the pool? Because there's no positive counterpart? Just fucking remove it! And oh, look, a pill that causes some people to feel nauseous playing the game, wonderful, I bet that was really planned out with beta testers. Hush. Cool boss design, everything about the fight is really well done, except the health. I understand the idea of the extra hard boss, the bullet hell style of fight, but 90% of the time it's a tedious slog, you can kill him, you know you can kill him, you can dodge the hits, it's just a matter of time, but the time is the issue because it's taking you 5 minutes to kill one thing. This is probably a preference issue but it's incredibly off putting, when you actively don't look forward to something in a game, and not because you're scared it'll kill you, that's likely not a good thing. Angel Rooms. When you have a room that requires some very, very specific criteria to be met to unlock it, you'd expect the contents of said room to be pretty good, right? 3 pennies. Holy Water. 4 spirit hearts behind 4 locks. I'm so glad I ignored Brimstone, Mom's Knife, and Incubus for this. When people will literally throw health away on a permanent level just to get precedent and never ever have to deal with this room, it's not that impressive. Oh I avoided taking any damage on this entire labyrinth floor that didn't drop any soul hearts, killed 2 bosses, and I get an Angel Room, I sure hope Sacred Heart or Godhead is in here! Nah, it's Holy Water. At least it's free! Oh wait I'm The Lost it's literally nothing. And now Devil Deals will never ever turn up again for some reason. (??????) You want to fight Mega Satan (so of course the path to do this gives you exclusively shit items and money) and you've managed to meet the criteria to unlock an Angel room, RNG was on your side and you feel like the completed key piece may eventually be yours, so you go into the room, and it's tiny, super Jesus spawns and proceeds to just buttfuck you into oblivion because he's kinda fast and there's nowhere to run. Somehow you come out on top with 1/2 a heart left and your key piece. Cue the rest of the run not giving you an Angel room because the arbitrary retarded rollercoaster that is the reasoning behind its generation decided you deserved nothing. Cheers game. Rag Man. Why is a boss who fires homing shots (of which the first shot of 4 I swear is a Sacred Heart homing shot) by the fucking dozen able to spawn these spiders that are considerably more tanky than your average spider? At least you can still hurt him while dealing with them temporarily, right? Wrong. He's just upped and decided to spawn 2 of them immediately for literally no reason, and now he's doing it again. Thanks buddy. Greed Mode. A fantastic mix up of the original formula, really love the mode and the idea of it. First floor, first wave, just black flies for like 3 spawns, easy! Not entirely sure why it's a wave but hey not complaining. Next wave, it's those bigger than the smaller spiders that spawn 2 spiders when they die, except there's like 6 of them. Next wave is the same thing, except you haven't dealt with the first ones. You've already been hit, you're Judas, there's nothing you can do except try fighting this ever growing horde of tanky bullshit. Super secret rooms. Why are there just spikes and literal shit in here? Were these rooms that could consist of nothing but hearts or pills that, as we've already discussed, will literally eat your face and cripple you, too good? Did they need to be nerfed? Rooms with fire or spikes right in front of you as you enter them. Why is that a good idea? Do you want people to slowly plod through the game by pausing as they enter each room? The fucking Boss Rush rooms with spikes around the items. Why are items constantly being put behind rocks and spikes? I have no health, or bombs, so now I just can't get an item. The rooms where it happens honestly look shoddy, like the game sort of bugged out for a second. With Boss Rush in particular, what's the fucking point? You already got there in 20 minutes, you met the fairly tight constraints to unlock the 'secret' and now you can't do anything with it. You get there as the Keeper? Enjoy not being able to get hit for the entire event. It's really like you're the original version The Lost! But worse somehow! The fact that some items completely fuck over others you pick up. It's got to the point where I will google item combos to make sure what I'm about to pick up doesn't break the game, and not in a good way. Ludo and Explosivo to name one, literally game losing the moment they collide. There's other shit but I've written a whole bunch of words that few are likely to read, I just wanted to rant because it irks me, the original seemed so much more balanced in comparison, this feels like they just threw shit at the wall to see what stuck and then kept the stuff that didn't stick in it anyway.

An *even larger* number of businesses &amp; people (advertising &amp; PR firms, and of course the graphic artists &amp; other staff people they employ) earn a significant PART of their living. -- Those people all now have a vested interest in keeping this stuff going -- to admit that it was false... Well, to admit it and DO SOMETHING about that (like quit or refuse to create/promote the material that one is ""tasked"" with, or even attempt to introduce some honesty or objectivity or even any caveats or ""doubt"")... well that would mean *not* being able to repay the student loans, or to pay the rent &amp; utilities, and of course in many cases to risk the house, the car, the health insurance, any ""presents"" for the kid(s), etc. Even far short of that -- even to admit *internally* and to themselves that it's ""not entirely true"" -- is to begin to *dislike* their job (and not just over trivial matters), and even, presuming there is some ""conscience"" present in each individual, to eventually begin to *hate themselves* for being complicit in such a large hoax, or fraud upon the public. -- So what do people do? Well, they engage in ""thought stopping"", that is they ""won't go there"", not even for a moment in their mind (or at least not if they can help it) will they contemplate any doubts -- in fact in order to avoid thinking those potentially ""heretical"" things, they will become *more* strident, recommit themselves to their core dogmatic belief(s). Which of course then provides more than sufficient fuel to go into work the following week and produce things like... well like the linked graphic. -- Thus the end result is much like the world of Orwell's *1984* the GOAL of a lot of this propaganda... ***isn't*** really to try to convince the ""proles"" (they're too busy being kept entertained &amp; occupied by the ""prolefeed"", i.e. what are the Kardashians up to, etc) -- rather its to try to keep the ""party members"" -- i.e. everyone ELSE in the government &amp; NGO ""industry"" (or the ""faith"" if you will) both thinking ""correct"" thoughts as well as to keep them ""keyed up"" to continue their own little complicit parts in maintaining the wider ""establishment"".But But ...

I wanted to go for kind of a ""free love"" thing, but I couldn't fit in fertility or debauchery. Hopefully we have a fertility god/goddess I can work with.

uid_346300,"I can be an astronaut but I can't be CF? Small rant. I (24f) was out to dinner with friends/acquaintances and the topic future plans came up. They asked what I wanted to do after I finished my PhD in astrophysics. I said I really enjoy academia and want to do post-docs and eventually get a permanent position in a university. This is very hard to achieve. I also joking said, ""but if that doesn't work out, I've always wanted to be an astronaut."" *Haha*. They laughed but then said ""If that's what you really want, you should stick to it."" and, ""It's not impossible."" and, ""Why the hell not? Someone has to do it."" One person even said, ""Don't let anyone tell you what you can and can't do."" So the usual, friendly encouragement of both my real goal and my big dream as you would expect from friends. Then came the other half of the conversation which followed immediately after this as it was still along the same lines of future plans, ""So when are you going to pop a sprog?"" and I told them I wasn't. I didn't want to. Pregnancy sounds awful, birth sounds worse and then, worst of all, a child. Urgh. Nope. **All** of them began saying ""You'll change your mind"", ""you're young"", ""it's different"" yada yada. Usually I'm pretty chill about this, I'm used to it. People can say what they like it doesn't change a thing. **However** they had *just* been saying that they believed I am old enough and educated enough to make the, quite frankly absurd, life choice **to become an ASTRONAUT.** Let me repeat that: an astronaut. As in leave our planet, pilot a rocket, go to mars, potentially do things no human has ever done before...

What's yours? **My endgame**: *get my favorite chars to lvl 50, true pirate wep, full oathbreaker accessories and play arena pvp only.* I love the arena pvp system in this game. Started with destro, now going with summoner and thinking about KFM, I also have a warlock and FM. I do dailies with Summoner/Warlock, and enjoy arena with destro. This game is a massive time sink, if you want to keep up with the pve content you have to treat it like a job. Some people say it's like a part-time job, but I think if you would have a hard time maxing your char out if you treated it as a full time job. Personally, I love the game for it's character creation, storytelling, costumes, and pvp. I am sure that no one enjoys wasting time on dailies, over and over again, every single fucking day. Some famous streamers also said that they've given up on the PVE content, such as Jaesung, and I realized that it's not worth investing that much time into this game. It would arguably be better to invest real money, saving you time and letting you enjoy the game for it's pve content without grinding your brains out. The new 6v6 dungeons are rubbish, the whole concept destroys the esports aspect of the game. As a proper csgo player, following most of the popular esports, the fact that BnS was huge as an esport was what drew me in to try this game, but now it's obvious that the game will die soon, just like NCSofts other projects, such as Lineage2 did. I see people in my clan grinding for 18 hours non-stop for some idiotic silverfrost quartz, so that they can achieve their ""dream"" of gaining an edge, or at least getting closer to catching up to the most geared people in the server, which will probably not happen. I think all of that is just blatantly stupid, and you need to stop for a moment and think what you're doing to yourself. Many new people come in every day, get mesmerized by this game, and make it their goal to get to the top PVE wise. In my opinion these people are just bad at math, because if you look at all the resources you'll need to get anywhere close to the endgame (time, money, luck, effort, skill), you can easily see that you're making a very bad investment, which will never pay off. For all the people who say ""I enjoy gear progression, who are you to tell me what I like or dislike, it's like fishing, just a hobby man, it brings me joy"" ok you can continue deluding yourself, I can only address people who are good at math and not randoms who like torturing themselves in front of a monitor. /rant I know my end goals, but I've always wondered what other people want from this game. What does the average,new,old player want? What's your endgame? Favorite chars? How good are you at arena pvp?This seems like the dumbest thread ever.. just because you gave up on PvE means that people who have not are bad at maths and so on, makes sense ""proper csgo player"".",-1

I went to check the AH for bargains, I noticed two Haunted Memento's for 7.5k and 9.5k (the only two on the market as far as I know). I decided to grab them, as I've sold a few back in Cata for about 15k each. Currently I've listed one of the two (on an alt) for 19k on the AH, while advertising the other one in /2 for 25-30k (depends how many responses I get in /w). The realm market value according to TSM is 24k. I realise they're a slow sell, but how do you guys I should proceed selling them for a decent profit?The Memento's are lower in price because they were nerfed, weren't they?",3

We've talked about it for awhile now and I've just now decided that I want to embark on this adventure with him. Now, I wouldn't say my parents are full on narcissists, but they definitely have their moments. Like today.. I went over there to hear their concerns and try to have them see my side of things. It turned into an hour of my dad telling me how I was making a mistake, that I should stay her where everything is comfortable and stable, and how I'm hurting them by making this decision. Okay, all valid reasons (I guess) but then he goes on to tell me that they've ""invested too much for me to throw it all away"". They're referring to the 12 years of Catholic school they spent on me to have a better education and to get ahead in life. I'm sorry, but I thought ensuring your child's education was part of being parent! Guess I was wrong there. Also, your daughter is an atheist and I'm no farther ahead in my career than any other kid who went to public school. Bit of a waste really if you think about it. They also think my boyfriend is brain-washing me to go with him.. Because I'm not capable of making my own decisions, obviously. Anyways, they said I can make whatever decision I want, but I should know that the right decision would be to stay...

uid_161121,"Question about Gamergate identity I am gonna ask a question about how you determine if someone is Gamergate or not. I subscribe to KiA for more than 1 year but i dont know if i am part of Gamergate or not, because i am too lazy to take an active part in Gamergate. If i am about to pick an ""identity"", maybe silent reader is the most correct one. And now i want to move to a part where me myself have only little understanding about it, so please fill me in if there is some fact that I wrote is wrong. There is a group that call themself Gamergate and active on doxxing people (i think it was baphomet from 4chan) but here at KiA, you all saying that they are not part of Gamergate. But who is has the power to saying someone is not Gamergate or not? Gamergate are leaderless. If everyone is equal here, than why someone opinion is better than the next person. If someone say he is Gamergate, how you can you explain to other people that he is not part of Gamergate because they take part at activity that you not approve (to be clear, i also dont approve doxxing), because, once again, i think every other person opinion here is equal, because there is no rank here at Gamergate. If you said they are not part of Gamergate because majority of people said so, what if, hypothetically, the ""dox"" Gamergate is the majority, will they become the true Gamergate? Right now what im seeing is, Gamergate has its own different faction. Even the user here often have different opinion on the same thread, and maybe the different in opinion is greater with Gamergate outside reddit (is 8chan Gamergate still considered same faction with reddit Gamergate?). And with that i back to my original question, how you determine someone is Gamergate or not?Gamergate is a type of ant, amirite?",5

No ofcourse not that'd be silly. You are saying that how you know this information is from *scientists* studying the history of our planet. Convenient that when *scientists* say this has happened before using evidence such as core sample, using theories and simulations, they conclude this is a continuing cycle. But when *scientists* say that humans have increased the rate of change (acceleration) of the climate change, it is unfounded and holds no weight. The problem is not whether or not climate change has existed in our past. By all accounts it looks like a cycle that took place over hundreds of thousands of years. The problem is that the cycle has been accelerated by humans to occur unnaturally. History of our planet has never seen this type of acceleration before, and what is difficult is trying to determine what effects this will have on the planet. For example, if climate change use to take 500,000 years to go from -20C to 20C, that gave animals 500,000 years to adapt, move locations, evolve to the difference in temperature. Now let's say that humans' impact on the planet will cause the same change (-20C to 20C) in only 50,000 years. Species which are use to adapting over 500,000 years now only have 50,000 to adapt.

He continued to slap the hell out of her legs with a belt and violently shaking her, yelling. I yelled at him and he mumbled something back, but continued to hit her. I called 911 and ran downstairs to stop the abuse, but before I could he dragged his daughter upstairs into the apartment complex. 4 squad cars showed up and I gave them a written statement of what happened. The officer told me that the girl ran away and the father was ""teaching her a lesson"". They were Chinese Americans, and the dad said that Americans don't know how to disciplin their kids.

uid_642612,"Fairly new to CS, looking for friendly people to play with. Hi guys. First off as a TL;DR, the title pretty much says it all. So to go into a little more depth: I'm a 21 year old Brit who's been interested in CSGO for a few years now. Started mostly watching tournaments and never really playing the game. Now I've played almost 300 hours, most of which I'd spent on training_aim_csgo and death matches, but constantly changing my settings so that my practice was never really all too fruitful. It's mostly been a game that I just pick up every so often, do a death match here or there and put down again. However, I actually really want to get good at CSGO. I'm not entirely sure what it is about the game but having watched people like KennyS and his almost inhuman reaction times, or how people like Olof and Fnatic as a whole, I can't help but sit in awe at the infinite skillcap this game has. So recently I've taken a step back and have changed all my settings to something I've felt comfortable with and have been forcing myself not to change things and I've been trying to incorporate CSGO into my daily routine so that I get consistent practice. I've mostly been playing on things like headshot only pistol death matches, a few awp servers and some other random things I've found on the community servers here or there. Last night for example, I was playing with a group on a server and someone asked what rank people were. It turned out there were quite a few DMGs and people around that rank with the 5yr vet coin and I'd held my own against them. I did die quite a bit, I won't deny but a few times there had been clutch situations and I killed their highest fraggers in 1v2 and 1v3 which felt pretty awesome. I've also been playing a lot more of Valve's death match servers and am usually the highest fragger or within the top 3. So basically I'm now sitting here wondering where exactly my skill level actually is. But the thing is I've yet to play any of the casual or competitive mode of the game so as good as my aim might be but probably isn't, I don't really understand the game's economy, when to and not to buy (although I've watched WarOwl's series on this, I've yet to practice it), callouts/place names and really just playing the game with a team. I read recently that casual really isn't a good game mode for people wanting to get into competitive. It's too lenient, you don't have to buy armour which effectively changes the way pistol rounds are played, no team fire or collision or anything of that sort so I'm feeling inclined to jump directly into competitive. However I know I'll get raged at if I do so without really understanding how the game should be played with outside of death matches and fun servers. None of my friends play the game and constantly refuse to do so whenever I ask them but I'd like to find a group of people I could play with fairly regularly so that I can get used to and learn the game in a nice environment. If you're much better than me, that'd help too because really, the only way to get better is to play people who shit on you until you learn, adapt and start holding your own.There's this Ukrainian kid that I hear is super friendly and an overall great teammate that would make your CS:GO experience amazing!",11

uid_41633,"why nobody proposes gender quotas for physically heavy work? I don't understand the whole argument that women can't do physically demanding work traditionally reserved to men. I would say they can do it, maybe not all of it but a good portion. my great-grandmothers and all my female ancestors before them used to do paesant work like making hay, bundle it up on their back and trasporting it, chopping woods, cropping, watering the vineyard with a water container that weighted like 50 lbs full to carry on their shoulders etc. not as much as my male ancestors but still enough hard labor to probably exhaust a lot of modern day men. they became used to it after years of practice because they didn't have the luxury to do anything different. today we have the technological know how to apply the lever principle and implement servomechanisms and various machineries to help ease the burden of physical labor in many instances compared to the past. I believe this reluctancy to include women in heavy works comes from a more or less unconscious belief that women's life is more valuable than ours because they are child bearers and they shouldn't waste themselves doing too much physical or hazardous work. whenever someone mentions gender quotas is always about leadership positions or company boards and no mention of steel mills or constructions. :-(Because giving women high paying, high powered, cushy jobs at the socio-economic right of the bell curve is just giving women their rightful places alongside men...but...making women carry their own weight in cleaning half the sewers, extracting and refining half the resources, performing half the manufacturing, constructing half the buildings, laying half the infrastructure and hauling half the fucking trash is misogyny, SHITLORD!",3

The other day I was looking for my earphones, I wanted to go for a jog and I wanted some music. I had the ipod in my hand, and I was walking around my apartment lifting up pillows, rooting through pockets, looking everywhere for my damn headphones. Finally I texted my girlfriend, who'd been in the house the day before, and asked her ""hey have you seen my earphones?"" She replied, ""I haven't actually, have you checked in blah blah blah?"" I did a big clean sweep of the place, figuring I might as well clean the damn apartment and surely the headphones would show up. They didn't. The next day, she came over to visit me. At one point I was in the shower. The next day after that, I found the headphones in my warddrobe, mixed in with some clothes tussled around. Now, let me say with 1000% certainty: they were not there before. She put them there. She ""planted"" the headphones there to make it look like I'd missed them. But she didn't realise I'd taken every single item of clothing out and *the headphones were not there*. The question is: why the fuck did she not own up and say ""oops, I took them by accident!"", or ""oops, I found them in my bag, I'll bring them back tomorrow"". That's all it would have taken, but she chose not to. She chose to pretend she did not have them, then put them right back where she knew I'd see them and think ""d'oh! how could I have missed that!"" She has no reason to try to fuck with my head.

I live in Burlington, VT and the city had to come to a strict agreement with Uber not to hire people with DUI's or sex offenses after an Uber driver was accused of sexual assault on a drunk passenger. It's ridiculous that the city would have to force Uber to make that an official policy, but then I came to find out that there is essentially no oversight of taxi companies here at all. They've been caught having drivers with DUI's, sex offenses, licenses suspended and a myriad of things you would assume would get you fired immediately. And if they are fired, what do they do? Move on to the next cab company. The judicial process takes far too long to remove specific drivers or revoke a companies license. I assume it's the same in many cities and legislators should update whatever laws to create some kind of checks and balances. It's common sense. Personally, I've had several cabbies make weird, sexual comments to females I was riding with. Most people are non-confrontational, so they'll try to politely deflect a creepy comment to avoid an awkward situation. I'll just tell them to their face they're being weird and inappropriate and it's always met with bewilderment, like they're just making small talk. They'll shut up eventually, but I can't imagine what it would be like as a female, alone in that situation. Especially at night when most passengers are leaving the bars, probably drunk. It's definitely a problem that needs to be dealt with in this city, but based on the way politics move here I doubt they'll do anything until someone actually gets assaulted or killed.Yes, much less safe to have the license plate, times/route, and picture of every driver you have on Uber than to have a random taxi driver...especially while drunk!",3

uid_236839,"I think one of the reasons you are getting some blow back on this is because messing with time means messing with technology and the timeline. D&amp;D is balanced based on what is possible in a roughly medieval setting and any character coming from the future necessarily would come with ideas that don't fit in the D&amp;D world. That means your character knows stuff they wouldn't already know. For example technology has the possibility of really messing up the balance of the game. Does your character want to build a gun? Does your character know about printing presses? About electricity? About mechanization? All of this has to potential to make your character troublesome to deal with. Keeping the game immersive is more difficult if you have a character always thinking ahead or trying to overpower the bad guys with ideas that no other character has access to because the world hasn't gotten there yet. Also if you are from the future, are you going to start trying to mess with major events from the past that you are currently living in? In a game this means you might have extra information and that means extra work for the DM to figure out what you may know. Of course because the game depends on dice rolls this makes it extremely hard on the DM because they don't actually know what will happen. It's not a bad concept but it is troublesome, and it may present extra difficulties for your DM, which is why you definitely need DM approval.Tbf, lots of (troublesome) players playing standard character builds have tried to invent gunpowder and other things their characters shouldn't have any concept of.",3

uid_152334,"Sorry to be ""that guy"" but I don't think anyone actually wants to do this. Most (not all) of us have figured out some means of watching the games by now, I use a VPN and my apple TV and it works just as well as regular cable, and only costs about 30$ a month. When I go to a game, i want a Dodger dog. When I go to a game, I don't want to have to smuggle things in. I need a new hat and I am buying a Seager jersey very soon. I want Dodger games back on TV as much as the next guy, but I'm definitely not willing to do *any* of this. Especially since I already get to watch the games anyways. The problem with this plan is that, again, most of us have *some* way of watching games, legally or otherwise. Just submit to TWC, either switch over or do what I do, but accept that you aren't going to change anything. TWC and the Dodgers are billion dollar industries, a few hundred or even thousand people not buying hot dogs isn't going to even make a fucking *dent* in their profit margins. It sucks and it's unfair but, hey, life isn't fair, you accept things and you move on. Buy an apple TV, get unlocator or hola or whatever VPN you want, set it up, and enjoy Vin's last season.

I have made an account for this project, and maybe future use for communication with the subreddit. Honestly, the story has become so complicated it's stressful. I want to bring the good old days back with a remaster of the first game. Now, I don't want to release a free version of the first game, so I will expand on it, but not too much. It will feature something from all the games in the franchise. The game's lore will be solvable without the need of another game, but it won't be as simple. Cutscenes or minigames might be present. I'm working on this myself. It will be made in Clickteam Fusion, and there isn't gonna be any teasers. The original game didn't have any. I will make a trailer however and submit the game to gamejolt soon. ~ Your newbie SideCrackedThe original game had ONE teaser.",1

Her son knocked on our door and asked if we wouldn't mind using our basset hound to find her elderly dog with dementia that had wandered off sometime in the night when the door got left open. He came to visit when his mother had called him in tears about the dog, apparently, but he had searched up and down the street and couldn't find her dog anywhere. The old lady didn't know us by name, but she always saw us walking our hound dog, so she was hoping we could help. Now, our dog had no scent training at all because he was a family pet but she was so heartbroken and her dog was already old and ill so we couldn't say no. We spent all day looking for her dog, and we actually found it! Our basset found the little guy in a rabbit den of all things, so we thought that he must have gotten cold and crawled inside the small space to get warmed up and then was too tired to make his way home. Six year old me was very excited, and I got to carry it back to her house and tell her all about it. After that, she used to invite me and my older brother to her house for cookies and juice.

Prices basically breakdown to $2500 a year for coverage with a $5000 deductible for any actual care or testing. Or $5000 a year for reasonable deductibles. If you get government stipends it should be much cheaper, but if you're middle class you probably will not qualify. In addition there is ZERO consideration for current financial situation outside how many family members you have. If you're in massive debt already to loans/creditors, but pass the basic income to not get a stipend, you're still up shit creek. Most of middle class people can't go taking $5000 financial burdens on without significant life changes or taking on significant debt. The same problems will certainly persist, I'm not going to be rushing off to get any healthcare unless it is a life or death situation, and my hesitation to do so will likely cause more health problems and in the end cost more for my care. This needs fixed, we can't just rely on the middle class to support everyone on Obamacare, we need the rich to chip in too even if they are not on Government healthcare plans.Yeah, the worst thing Obamacare ever did was to introduce high deductible plans into the insurance marketplace.",0

USB controllers aren't really meant for good hard drive throughput performance. There are special interfaces for hard drives. Plus... you have all those discrete devices. I mean, it could work alright for just data storage, but probably performs shitty. Plus those shitty thumb drives can have relatively high failure rates. Not a big deal for the occasional file transfer, but if you start re-writing to it a ton (swap file or whatever) then it wouldn't be surprising to start getting errors pretty quickly.It helps to defrag and securely wipe free space as often as possible for best performance and longevity.",6

uid_585698,"guys, i need some advice short version: i'm 30, single, a returned missionary, and an atheist (which i've only just recently admitted to myself, though i've been inactive/less active for about 7 years now). my family is of the opinion (voiced with relative frequency) that i need to find a good wife and i'll settle down and everything will go back to the way things were when i first got home from my mission. my sister (the main ""offender"") is 24, married to the ward mission leader, two kids, has a master's in early childhood education, a primary teacher... basically the epitome of the perfect mormon wife. i know that what she does, she does out of love and genuine concern for my ""eternal soul"". after all, i can't make it to the celestial kingdom without an eternal companion. i know this because i used to believe the same thing. but this past week she did something that for some reason has really gotten under my skin: she set me up with a complete stranger (to her as well as me) for no other reason than the fact that we both live in the same city. basically, she met a girl who lives in my same city (and who she described as ""very attractive"") and gave her my phone number, telling her to give me a call. i don't know much about the exchange other than that. what i do know is that i got a call from this girl - who just finished her first year of law school at BYU and is working an internship with the DA here - offering me a ride to church. i've *never* been more uncomfortable on a phone call. luckily, i was out of town on sunday, so i was able to at least delay said fellowshipping effort, but i have a very difficult time saying ""no"" to people - especially people i don't know, so i agreed to ride with her next week (though i had forgotten that i'm going to be out of town again, so there'll be another awkward phone convo where i delay again). so here's my dilemma: i don't know what this girl's expectations are - i'm not opposed to going on a date with her, but i *really* don't want to be a reactivation project. i don't know exactly what my sister told her, either. my sister at this point knows i'm ""not that into the church"". she knows that i smoke - or at least her husband does, and i'd be seriously surprised if he'd kept that secret from her. my father knows i drink, and he found my condoms a while back while helping me clean my old car for sale. even if he hasn't shared these things with my sister, there are other signs. i rarely attend church when i'm visiting her or my parents. i didn't stand in the circle during her sons' baby blessings, and when my best friend since childhood got married last month, i waited outside the temple. i've never had a formal ""i don't believe"" talk with any of my family, but they know i'm not the wide-eyed RM i once was. i'm actually really upset about this. i don't like confrontation. i love my sister to death, and i don't want to do anything to alienate her from me. at the same time, i can't handle her attempts to save me - especially not if it involves pimping me out to random strangers. any advice (on either problem - how to talk to my sister, or how to approach interaction with this new girl) would be greatly appreciated.All you have to do is meet her and ask, ""Are you willing to be second wife to a hot lesbian latino sister from my mission?""",1

The still small voice kept telling me, ""you're in a hurry; your parking meter may run out"". But I didn't want to be a jerk to these earnest kids. About 20 seconds of polite conversation about why I'm not interested in their message revealed that these baby faced hunters and fishers of the Lord knew not about a) Joseph Smith's polygamy/child brides, b) the seer stone method of translation, or c) the basic Egyptian funerary text content of the facsimilies. In my heart of hearts I knew that I needed to keep walking, but it seemed rude to recite a laundry list of doctrinal//historical issues, drop the mic, and walk away, so I chatted with them for a couple of minutes as I tried to politely end the conversation and work my way back to my car. Lo and behold, when I got to my car there was a meter cop tucking a ticket under my windshield wiper, just as 'the spirit' had suggested to me there would be. I'd like to bear my testimony that this church is not true. I know that the spirit of rational thought is there to guide me through my days as long as I don't allow my judgment to be clouded by sentimental affection toward hapless Mos. I know that if we heed the promptings of rational thought, we can live happier lives, free from the needless suffering that happens when we succumb to the outwardly friendly face of the church and get sucked into its toxic culture and insane doctrine.

uid_444891,"Mistaken for an Employee, a Lifelong Affliction Due to a few other posts recently, I've decided to post my own similar situations of being confused for an employee. Mind you I've been a contractual employee or self employed for years, so I generally have a viking beard, hair down to the middle of my back, and I often wear combat boots and band shirts. I'm assuming that I somehow radiate an aura of responsibility, confidence, or sage-like knowledge that they mistake for authority. Now, if it were an anomaly that only happened once in my life, that would be one thing, but oddly it seems to happen about once every few months. I'll be doing my shopping, and someone will approach me and ask for assistance, or where a product is. If it's something simple, like reaching for something that a shorter customer cannot reach, I'll do it, even though I'm a few inches shorter than 6 ft. However, after having dealt with two incidences of indignation, I decided that perhaps the best way to deal with irate customers is to have a little fun. The two incidences that lead me to this decision were a fellow customer cursing me out for not ""going in the back"" to check on a large screen television for him (mind you this was at a store where the employees are all well groomed, wear blue shirts and khaki pants, and I'm dressed like Rob Zombie), and a woman at a bookstore complaining because *""an employee should know the newest release on Oprah's book club""*. These happened within two weeks of one another, and both times I simply stood there, chuckling. So, I decided the best way to deal with such people is to perform my ""job"" in such a way that would assuredly get me ""fired"", or at least result in hilarity. A few times it's just been directing customers to non-existent departments, such as the ""German"" department in Walmart when a customer was looking for clock radios, or the ""Apparel"" department in an electronics store when a customer was looking to speed up their computer (*""Sir, you're going to need more RAM, you'll find it right next to the headlight fluid and the waffles.""*) Although, to be honest, the best had to be when some obvious soccer mom was asking me for a cook book, and I told her that the best one I ever found was *""120 Days of Sodom""* by the Marquis deSade. I explained that the book was written centuries ago when ""Sodom"" was how they spelled ""Sodium"" and it was full of recipes involving salt.Well, you look like a bum, so *obviously* the only job you can get is stocking shelves.",4

He's often been OP, generally a top-tier priority, with some brief moments of either good balance or shit-tier (though he's been mostly fine the last few weeks). His talent diversity isn't always 100% optimal. He can always use some more tweaking. But there are over 50 other heroes in this game, many of whom have received minimal or no changes in months and need significantly more work than KT does. How many times was KT changed before a single balance change was made to Dehaka? When was the last time Murky got a significant talent change, despite now being hard countered by half the hero pool? Four out of five of Nazeebo's level 4 talents are generic ones, and while I know you're in the process of a rework he could at least use *something* there. Poor Hammer had lost her will to live ever since we got to two powerful mages that countered her, and now there are *four*. Tassadar has basically negative talent diversity. So please, I get it, you guys and gals love KT and want him to be just right (insert Pacha-as-KT meme), but PLEASE just give it a rest for a bit and give other heroes some attention. I know you guys are busy and always trying to make the game better, but at this point it isn't even about how balanced or unbalanced the character is, just how much freaking work goes into him as opposed to pretty much any other hero in the game. Yes, we hear that reworks are coming. Yes, we see other heroes getting minor tweaks. But it's become a joke at this point that KT can't go more than a patch without tweaks or it might break the game somehow. So give it a rest for, like, three patches at least. Please. He's fine. Is he perfect? No, but he's *fine*, and there are a *lot* of heroes in this game who aren't and need your attention far more urgently. Please, give it to them and let poor KT rest for a bit.

Other things I've seen around this sub before were to change her passive to have her power increase by 5% or something each time she gets a crit for 2-3 seconds and it stacks 3 times or something. Then just give her passive 15% crit. (i'm pulling these numbers from nowhere just focus on the general idea) make it so her traps give vision but at half the range or something of normal wards. I see where this idea is coming from. wards win games. But I dont know how to feel about it and dont know how helpful it'll be towards getting to late game. Like is the money you save on wards really going to add up that much make her 3 cripple for 2 seconds so she can use her ult and not worry about people getting out of range like the way hou yi does. What ideas do you guys have that could help Artemis reach late game a tiny bit easier?put golden bow back,2

uid_786323,"From one formerly super stinky nerd to another, this is how to not stink like a cliche stinky nerd. TL/DR: Wash your damn clothes, don't wear the same clothes two days in a row. Let me preface this by saying, naturally, I sweat profusely, probably more than you've ever met, and I stink BAD. I noticed it was a problem, so I had to adapt and change some lifestyle habits. Here are some simple things you might not do that will make you stink significantly less. This is also good advice for you mid-teens going through the super-stank phase. 1 - When you shower, actually SCRUB your pits with whatever shower scrub you use. For heavier dudes, also scrub your very lower back (this is where a lot of that ass-stank builds up, it's not actually ass, it's the fold between your ass and your lower back). 2 - Apply deodorant immediately after showering (after drying of course) 3 - WEAR A CLEAN SHIRT. No point doing all that, and then putting on a slightly stinky shirt. Don't sniff your shirt and think 'oh that's ok'. It's not. Just because you can't smell it, doesn't mean you don't stink. In summer, unless you're sitting in air-con all day, you should definitely be washing your shirts after a whole day's wear. 4 - Again, wash your god damn shirts. I know many stinky people that shower daily, but they don't wash their clothes anywhere near often enough. You're thinking, 'at TI where am I going to do laundry?' In the hotel/hostel/your friend's place bathroom sink. Fill the sink with water, get a bar of soap, soak your shirt, get it a little soapy, scrub the pits with the bar of soap. Rinse, ring, hang somewhere. This takes 2-3 minutes per shirt. Now you can wear this shirt 1 or 2 days later depending on how fast it dried. In fact while I travel, I do this while I am in the shower. Bonus less stank points: If you are going to be out all day, and are going to have a small backpack, pack a change of shirt, and a small packet of wet wipes. In the early afternoon, go to a bathroom, use wet wipes to wipe down your pits and wherever else need, apply more deodorant, then put on a new shirt. It's like a mini shower (DO NOT DO THIS AS A SHOWER SUBSTITUTE). Bonus 2: If you're a dude that stinks no matter what you do, try clipping your arm-pit hair, it takes 10 seconds, and no, it's not gay. If you have a lot of hair there, and you have some BO, there's probably a lot that's sitting in the hair, and won't wash out. A lot of wrestlers and other athletes who are sweating for large portions of the day do this for this reason. You can live almost infinitely off 3-4 shirts doing this. It's easy, and it will make you stink incredibly less, almost no stink at all.an actual PSA in here while the joke PSA is upvoted.",12

(To more easily pass down bank balls, and would make previously impossible combinations, such as Moon Ball Umbreon/Eevee, suddenly possible.) * Give me a place like the Battle Resort in ORAS where I can hatch eggs by just holding down a button. * Put a move re-learner, move deleter, and move tutors all near the breeding center.

Just because a vast majority considers GT non canon doesnt mean EVERYONE sees it as non canon as far as I know a lot of people see GT as being canon even if it destroyed Dragonball for most. Also Toriyama doesnt even own Dragonball anymore. Its like saying everything past Season 4 of the Simpsons is no longer canon because by that time Matt Greoning stopped writing/producing the show since hes the original creator. And saying Battle of Gods is canon just because toriyama designed and wrote some of the stuff is also saying every other movie is canon since Toriyama did have involvement in production of those like he did with Gods, as far as Im aware he designed broly, coola, android 13, etc and had direct input in them so if you consider Gods canon you have to consider every other movie Canon.

uid_792344,"Anxiety about upcoming dinner (literally in an hour) help please! Tuesday evening my husband and I were at dinner at my parents house. I hadn't seen them or spoken to them for a few days and it was nice, to say the least. At dinner, I said something about Melania Trump's speech. I'm not looking to get into a political debate but I'm not a Trump fan and they're hard-core, deluding themselves Republicans. Anyway, after some ""debate"" (them yelling at me and telling me I don't know what I'm talking about) they ended with saying to themselves (but directed at me) ""of course she doesn't know what she's talking about, she's INTELLECTUALLY DISHONEST."" And then finally to me, ""INTEGRITY IS IMPORTANT. (Implying that I have none)."" Now, first of all, that was really fucking mean. I ended up crying in the car for a minute just because I couldn't deal with being yelled at like that FOR MY REASONABLY JUSTIFIED POLITICAL BELIEFS. So, the reason why I'm reaching out is that I haven't spoken to them since then -- because you don't get to be a massive asshole to me and then have me be super happy to tell you about my life. But now I have to see them at dinner at a mutual friend's house. I stood up for myself a little bit today when I (indirectly) told them husband &amp; I would be driving ourselves to dinner...but they haven't responded to that and it's giving me major anxiety. You know when the N hears something they don't like so they don't talk to you but you know they're plotting something to punish you later? That's what it's been all day and I'm really freaking out about it. IF they manage to remain civil today, unfortunately, I promised to spend time with my little brother tomorrow so I'll have to see them then too. Any ideas on what to do for tonight?

Russia should have no say in what Ukraine chooses to do as a sovereign nation, and until Ukraine directly threatens Russia, Russia's opinion on the geopolitical moves of a sovereign nation should be irrelevant. It's Ukraine's choice, Ukraine's choice alone, and Russia's blatant, illegal interventions are nothing short of imperialism.

We condemn the right for attacking and stonewalling Obama at every turn, yet turn around and do the exact same thing when Trump wins office. This is how American Democracy works, whether we like it or not, whether the system is broken or not, this is how it is and these people must accept that. Furthermore, maybe if the millennial generation would get to the polls with as much vigor and enthusiasm as they are using to riot and protest, perhaps then Trump wouldn't have won. I don't believe for a second that even 80% of these protestors voted against Trump or even voted in general. What a sad time in America. I don't want a Trump presidency, but I respect that he is our president and we need to come together as a country for once and work together. Stop rioting and start trying to set an example like Obama tried to and be bi-partisan, work with the Republicans. Otherwise, how can we expect anything different from them the next time a Democrat is elected?

uid_614032,"Which should make you far more capable of supporting these causes. Companies are responsible for the interests of all individuals involved in their operation. This includes employees, suppliers, shareholders (if registered on a stock exchange), etc. Let's say that 5000 people have an interest in some kind in this company - whether their wages are being paid or they have stock ownership or whatever - and you suddenly decide to start funneling profits toward environmental efforts instead of paying more wages or doing a dividend because it's the ""right thing to do for the environment"". The money's got to come from somewhere. My question to you is just this: where do you get off assuming you have the right to make a decision with the money of 5000 people? While Jane in sales might support the company's decision, Joe in manufacturing with 3 kids and a wife in the hospital probably needs every penny he can get. I am grossly oversimplifying but the point is that it's not about money for the sake of greed, or fuck the environment, or anything like that. Money is simply the most mutually agreeable end result of a company's operations, which is the work of many people and teams combined, since they can then decide for themselves what to do with that money. Jane can donate to rainforest restoration, and Joe can make a payment on his second mortgage. Always baffles me when people think companies just have money that they could be using to save the environment and they are laughing maniacally in the board room and keeping it there, not using it on purpose. There is no such thing as ""extra money"" in a company - it always has 15819823 places it could go to improve the company, pay wages, or pay dividends.But, like... corporations, man!",1

If 1 hour is 2 hours, we're already talking astronomic unit sized stars or something.

uid_761780,"I fired my brother today, AND IT FELT GREAT!!! So to give you a little back story. My parents have had a construction company for over 22 years.They have over 34 full-time employees. So as you can guess they have a pretty good size company. Every now and then I would come work for them as a supervisor or foreman. I ended working for a few start-up companies and a few building maintenance companies just to get some more experience in building construction. My brother on the other hand, has never held a job in his life. He's 22, didn't graduate high school, has no plans to go to college and him and his girlfriend live with my parents. He has spent the past four years of his life ""working"" for my parents business. He also persuaded my dad to hire his girlfriend for secretary and office work. Now we all know about the horrible things he has done to the company. Recently we caught him stealing over 5,000$ a month by having his girlfriend write him a company check. Every so often when our payroll lady was sick his girlfriend would take over for the day. To this day he has stolen over 36,000$. My parents just swept it under the rug and pretended like it never happened. He would come in to the office and start yelling at the employees for not saving ""his"" parking spot. Our office is located in a commercial building with multiple tenants. No one has saved or assigned parking. But there is one spot in particular under a tree that he likes to park his truck under. A few years back he go mad at my dad and went out to our lot and slashed all our company truck tires. He stoled a company truck one year and got really drunk and ended up crashing it into another vehicle. My parents ended up paying over 100,000 to the person he hit. He even flipped an employees desk over because he didn't get out of the bathroom quick enough when my brother had to use it. We ended up paying for a brand new iMac for the employee and new iPad since they where his personal ones and they broke when my brother flipped the desk. Now some people might ask ""Why did your parents allow him to do any of those things?"" My dad would always say ""He's my son, he has no where else to go, otherwise if he didn't have me, he would be sleeping under a bridge."" But the part that got to me the most, the thing that made me mad the most, was when my brother told his girlfriend of three years that as soon as he got the company, he was going to sell it and move to Hawaii. My father spent 22 years of his hard work, tears and blood building this company, and he just wants to sell it to collect the money and move away leaving so many people unemployed and families without food. Well last month my father called me and asked me to come by the office. He sat me down and said ""Whosaidmr, we have come to decision, your mother and I are going to give you the company, we believe that it will be best in your hands since you have more business experience than your brother and you know the business"". I could not believe to tell you how excited I was. I didn't even think of them ever giving me the company. And right when my dad said those words the only thing I could think about is ""The first thing I'm going to do is fire my brother"". So yesterday after a month long process of signing all the corporate documents and bank accounts in my name (without my brother finding out) we finally finalized everything with our lawyer. I was now the proud owner of a construction company. A well established and well know company. My father and mother would collect 10% of the companies monthly earnings until the last one of them dies. Then after that the 10% would go into a private savings account to be scattered among all the grandchildren when the last one turns 18. Today was my first day in my new office. And today was the day I knew I was going to fire my brother. Upon arriving to the office I decided to park in ""His"" parking spot. I went up to my office, sat in my chair, and waited. I waited almost 3 hours till he finally showed up 2 hours late. I can hear him come into my office thinking that its still my dads office. As soon as he opens the door and sees me he says, ""What the fuck are you doing in here faggot?"" ""No, the questing you should be asking is what the fuck your doing coming into my office without knocking"" I said to him. ""Your office, are you fucking stupid? You don't work here, this is dads office"" he replied. "" Not anymore according to this document"" I said as I handed him the forms stating that I was now the owner. He started to look and read the documents, his face turned white as if he's seen a ghost. I could see his anger is his face, and he started to clench his fist. He ripped the papers and threw them right into the air screaming ""You fucking backstabber, this is supposed to be my company, you took it from me, your own brother, you took the company from your only brother, I have no where else to work, I have no skills and no where else to go"" he said. ""Im not going to sell the company like you are, dad figured that it would be best to leave it in my hands, but what I can tell you is that yes your right, you have no skills, you have no where else to go, no one else will hire you, and i feel pity for you that you never realized that sooner, but you where a very big expense to mom and dad, your stole money, you destroyed company property, we lost big contracts because of you and how you act on job sites, so for that I have no pity or feelings, and I don't care what you do with your life, but I can't tell you one thing, something that has had a long time coming, something that should have happened sooner, your fired, and your girlfriend is fired too, get the fuck out of my office"" I said. Now at this moment he was mad, he was really angry, I could see it in his face and body. He was about to charge at me and just as I predicted he ran right at me with his fist. Luckily I predicted that this could happen so I asked some of my foreman who showed up early to stay outside the office incase they need to help escort him out. As soon as they heard him running towards me they ran into the office and tackled him to the ground. They picked him up as he was kicking and screaming and threw him out the front door. That was about six hours ago and I haven't seen him or heard from him since. He did call my dad and my dad called me to tell me ""The business is yours, you can hire and fire whoever you want."" My brothers girlfriend didn't come into work either, not surprising, but Im sure she got the message.I can't tell who I am more disappointed with OP: You for not keeping your brother's girlfriend on staff and fucking her or your Parents for not teaching you how to properly ruin a human being's life.",5

As we go through the process of ringing up the customer, the TV is placed behind the register and out of sight so I can scan it. **Customer:** Oh wait... The customer grabs a soda from the Fridge at the register and scans it just as another customer walks up. **Me:** Okay, that will be 602 dollars. **Customer 2:** WHAT!?!? Me and the customer look up and noticed the look on the woman's face as the first customer gets out his credit card. **Customer 1:** (Without missing a beat) Yeah. The price of Soda shot through the roof last night. The stuff is like liquid gold now. He frowned a bit as he slid his card. **Me:** Thank you, sir.

uid_634791,"Why pretend to call yourself a World War I game, if you're not going to adhere to the era? #whining You're a soldier in World War I, chances are you are armed with a bolt action rifle, from either the allies or the enemy side. That's it. I don't know what history books Dice were drawing from, but the over proliferation of hand held SMGs, hand held MGs, and a dazzling array of sniper optics (they really weren't that common in WWI) essentially spit in the face of the concept of Standard Issue, give up all pretense this is a WWI game, for the sake of ""Hurp, it's fun!"" I get that these games cost millions to make, and they have to build the game for the lowest common denominator call of duty player to make their money back. But why WWI if you're not even going to enforce weapon regulations. (response to those ""it's an option, you can turn it off chuckleheads further down). I get it, ""because it's fun"" and you know what, this game is actually pretty fun, in an arcade I'm running around in a defensive circle at C point shooting people in the back this is fucking retarded, kind of fun. - The same for the tank play, except you can pick your nose at the same time. Not to mention, it's really bullet spongy, I'm sure we've all emptied a clip into a horseman and he's still trucking along like he's playing single player Skyrim, giving no fucks at all. Oh and the mobility, amazing, did you know you can carry a rifle, 3 charges of TNT, a gas mask, an anti tank rifle - and sprint non stop as if you were part of the Russian Olympic track and field team? Well of course you can! it's fun! hyuk hyuk. Ultimately I would of liked a game that was tailored around actual shit that was happening in WWI, not an SMG sniper fest, where tanks aren't broken pieces of shit like they were in WWI. No instead we get this game that doesn't know what it wants to be, too scared to depart thoroughly from its battlefield 3 and 4 trends, despite calling itself Battlefield 1. Why not Battlefield 5? Is the number 1 to signify a departure of something or a formula? Because it sure doesn't look like it. And some nay-sayers will just hand wave this, and say ""WELL THERE's AN OPTION FOR YOU TO ONLY HAVE BOLT ACTIONS IN THE SERVER CREATION, USE THAT."" Yes, I just also hope there's an option to pull up the maps that don't exist that are tailored to bolt action gameplay. One could complain about the tanks and vehicles too and you would argue back ""WELL JUST REMOVE THEM IN SERVER OPTIONS"", that would leave maps like Sinai desert, a walking simulator. The point being, all the maps are getting designed to be played a specific multi-armed call of duty with tanks way. Not for methodical bolt action, tough as balls gameplay. That's a shame. So in the name of ""fun"" we decided to sacrifice every element of what WWI as a fighting era is; a ball breaking agony. Instead, give all the soldiers steroids, and pretend like SMGs and Scopes were ""just how it was"". Shit then, why not include wall jumping? It's fun right? You just gave up giving two shits about the era 3 game design sessions ago. Hey you can always leave an option to turn it on and off in the options right? Why not jet packs? Hyuk.Play Verdun",8

uid_276938,"How would you feel about more scripted/plot important unit promotions in Fire Emblem? I was thinking about this the other day when I was replaying Conquest. When I promoted Corrin to Nohr Noble I got to thinking about how cool it would be if Corrin's character portrait actually changed outfits on promotion to their promoted class, and I imagined a scenario where you prove your worth to Garon so he bestows a title on you leading to your promotion. Similar to Ike, Micaiah, Sothe, and Volke in the Tellius games. Of course I would hope that they wouldn't be super late promotions like Roy's in Binding Blade. But I also got to thinking, what if certain characters had Paralogues that they unlocked at max level that they needed to complete to promote? These would be characters that are fleshed out enough to not be just an average unit, but not quite as important as the main lord and the most important cast members. It'd be a paralogue with a special objective and conditions relevant to the character. Similar to the Hidden Truths DLC where you can only use the units that the chapter gives you. Perhaps maybe only the characters that have A supports and up with the character who is the focus of the paralogue? As well as any characters who are canonically very good friends with the main one. I just felt that unit promotions felt a little too uneventful when they could be used as good story telling moments. All these units have aspirations that I thought could be tied to their promotion. Like Mia becoming a swordmaster, Sophie hoping to become a great cavalier like her father, Arthur becoming a hero, etc.I like the idea of promotions incorporating story elements (Great Lord Chrom having/not having the Fire Emblem depending on the player's point in the story is neato mosquito) but I'm not sure I really want forced unit promotions.",5

Going in to it I'll admit I was pretty anti-GG. I'm not sure how anyone can look at all the claims of misogyny and abuse and not be at least a little bit against it. I posted it in Kotakuforaction. Ok, not a smart move on my part, but I'd assumed it was a discussion subreddit rather than a pro-GG one. As I watched my karma plummet, I was bombarded with ""prove it was us"" and ""citation needed for the harassment"" etc. While I wanted to say something along the lines of ""don't pretend you've no idea what I'm on about"" I was left with the reality that I had no proof at hand. I've been looking in to the pro-GG side for the last few days. For most of it I felt like that cartoon on the right. Some of the examples I was given were very weak, but others were genuine concerns about games journalism. I am against everything that the anti-GG side says GG are about. I'm for the ethics in games journalism that the pro-GG side says GG are about.

The game really made me realize how much people will want to take advantage of you and use you any chance they get, but that by believing in yourself and in those you trust you can reject what is thought of as ""normal"" or ""right"" and do what you believe in. Even though some may think that what you do is abnormal or unusual, what matters the most is that you have confidence in yourself and in what you are doing.

The Beast yelled at her three times at most -once when she refused to join him for dinner, once when she almost touched the enchanted rose, and once when hot water stung his wounds- before he opened up to her. You don't get Stockholms for being yelled at three times, if you get it at all. (Stockholms is actually kinda rare, with roughly 8% of kidnapping victims developing it - after going through months or even years of repeated verbal, physical, and emotional abuse.) If the Beast kidnapped Belle and she started warming up to the Beast while he remained angry and out of control, then she might have had Stockholm. But that's not what happened. Belle volunteered to stay in place of her father, who was imprisoned for trespassing, and didn't start warming up to the Beast until he started to control his temper and becomes a kinder gentler person.

Although Westerosi customs differ from real life, in some parts of the world, the idea of men kissing other men could be associated with homosexuality. * In S4E3, Loras eats an apple. In medieval iconography, apples were associated with sin and temptations, and homosexuality in particular. He also attracts the look of Oberyn Martell, another character speculated by fans to engage in sex with men. * In S5E1, Loras lies in bed with Olyvar. Olyvar is heavily implied to be a man. * In S5E3, Brienne mentions that Renly ""liked men"".

uid_926696,"Wrestling in highschool isn't the most popular spectator sport. Wrestling in highschool on a team that is co-op with another school makes it even less popular. Most of us who were well known and had social lives nobody said or tried anything, but there was one kid on our team who was an oddball, small, dorky, squeaky voice and hung out with the weird kids, pretty unpopular and not well known at all. Some douchebag from the hockey team liked to pick on him and tried to fuck with his backpack and shit at lunch. The problem was that this oddball geeky kid had hands down the best wrestling pedigree of anyone on the entire team. His father, uncle, grandfather, all of them were champions, he practically came out of the womb wrestling. So when this hockey douche tried to pick a fight with him in the lunch room, what followed was one of the most onesided asswhoopings that I'd ever seen. He basically hip tossed the kid into the shadowrealm.HE CROSSED THIS N*GGA INTO THE SHADOW REALM",48

uid_94948,"Did Merged Zamasu tank or dodge SSB Vegetto's Final Kamehameha? I've watched and rewatched the fight between Vegetto and Zamasu plenty of times now, as it's my favorite sequence so far in *Super*. One thing that always strikes me as interesting is the Final Kamehameha at the end of their fight (before Vegetto defuses). When Merged Zamasu emerges from the smoke, he seems unscathed by the blast, which, as Kaioshin points out, contained pretty much the rest of Vegetto's energy. However, Future Trunks, who is *far* below SSB Vegetto, regardless of his Super Saiyan Rage and the Spirit Bomb Sword (or whatever that's going to be dubbed), managed to slice right through Merged Zamasu. I already realize I'm looking far too into this, but I wanted to provoke some discussion since the actual episode discussion has long passed. Is it ambiguous? My idea (which to me, makes the most sense) is that the Final Kamehameha *did* hit Merged Zamasu, weakened him by far, and allowed Future Trunks to slice through him. And yes, I do realize that Goku and Vegeta also gave energy to the damned thing, but they were badly injured at that point. Also, in terms of power, how would you rank Goku, Vegeta and Trunks this arc? And how close do you guys think SSB Vegetto is to, say, Beerus and Whis? There's only mere speculation at this point, but I would wager SSB Vegetto is *far* from either of them.I'm in the party of Zamasu tanking it, being mostly fucked up, plays it off cool because he'd never admit he's been hurt, and then gets the last 10% of his strength fucked out of him by Trunks plus spirit sword plus Goku and vegeta energy",49

The trick can be used when your opponent is on a breakaway. You hold triangal (ps3) for a split second and then let go. It will appear that you are going to rush your goalie at the attacker, but the goalie will stop when you release triangal. Ussually the opponent will shoot a chip shot or finesse shot when they see your goalie take one step, but the goalie will stop and make an easy save.Wow, groundbreaking stuff.",10

And then, I realized about my own Kharazim play: I'm always proud of my numbers. But, like Nazeebo, Kharazim constantly puts out numbers. You can tank a minion wave by yourself and get 1k healing. Do a camp, get 1k healing. But like Nazeebo, a lot of the time, those numbers are too gradual to help, and not at crucial times.

uid_645552,"Yeah, I can give you some info. Firstly, it's not against PayPal's terms of service to sell bitcoins. You are totally allowed to do that. Secondly, let's talk about chargebacks. In PayPal, you can *either pay with your PayPal balance or a credit/debit card*. If you pay with your balance, PayPal has control over all funds and all disputes. You can also send as *friends and family or goods and services*. Friends and family payments **cannot** be reversed by PayPal when paying by balance, whereas goods and services payments **are disputable**. Let's say the customer disputes the payment (if made by G&amp;S). You now have to fight the case - sending bitcoin txids and chat logs to prove you send the bitcoins, etc. It's a hassle. However, if the customer does **not** pay by balance and pays with a card instead, then no matter whether he sends as F&amp;F or G&amp;S, he **can** chargeback the payment by contacting his issuing bank and having the payment reversed. If this happens, there's nothing you can do. So, if you want to do this: 1) Only deal with **reputed people** and **small amounts** 2) When dealing with non-reputed people, take payments from **balance only** and make sure they send as **friends and family**. It's not worth the hassle to fight a case if they chargeback. That's it. Hope this helped.Payments sent as friends and family can also be reversed if the person claims the use of their account was unauthorized.",1

I held him and cried ""I'm scared of my mother visiting, I don't want her to guilt me"" as I have problems with blaming myself over every little thing (side effect of Nparenting) I'm woken up on Sunday by a bunch of phone calls, and hear my kid sister wailing at the other side of the door, I look at my phone and see a string of texts ""we came all this way to see you, you're making your sister cry, let us in"" I tell my mother no, she's not welcome, and that I will see my sister on my own terms. My mother proceeded to send me image messages of my sister crying. I threatened to call security on her, and she just stopped responding Both my boyfriend and I were shaken up badly by the whole indecent. after a bit of emotional healing, I sent her a message telling her why what she did was upsetting and wrong. she responded ""i don't know what to say, everything I do or say is wrong"" Hopefully I'll be taking my sister out sometime this week, its unfair that she had to be involved in this.You know, nothing says mature adult like using a young child for blackmail",4

uid_854188,"Maybe Elvis would be better if he got a day off sometimes? Aside from catcher, shortstop is the most demanding position physically. But nobody in the major leagues has more plate appearances than Andrus since 2010. The only one who's close is Robinson Cano. The next SS who's on the list is Alcides Escobar who has about 400 fewer plate appearances than Elvis over the last six years. That's 67 fewer per season and I don't think that's insignificant. When it comes to innings played at shortstop, Elvis there are a few shortstops who have more over the same period of time: Alexi Ramirez (7708), Escobar (7468.2), Starlin Castro (7297). Andrus has 7292.2 while Ian Desmond has 60 or so fewer innings (7229.2). After that top five it drops way, way off. Additionally, while Elvis was young in 2010 and 2011, he made deep post season runs in those years which are not included here. He's the only SS who's done that twice. Escobar did it last season with the Royals. So maybe Andrus would be better if they didn't try to treat him like he's Cal Ripken? Maybe the kid is just tired and has had ailments build up oh him over the years? You know he does play half of those games in Texas. As most of us know the summer heat starts early and doesn't quit until October, but he's played in 861 of a total of 904 regular season games. Ramirez has a few more games but fewer plate appearances and plays in a relatively mild climate in Chicago. Oh and Elvis also leads the majors in pitches seen since 2010. The next shortstop on that leaderboard is Castro and he's seen 1773 fewer pitches than Andrus. If the Rangers want to get more out of Andrus, one thing they could try is picking up a utility infielder who can play short every four or five days. Utility infielders are cheap.I agree he needs some time off as does Beltre who has played everyday since back.",5

In any kind of negotiations, whether it's business or political, it's important to know what your value may be your opponent, and what's something that they will not accept. And the yahoos did things that is not acceptable to Beijing, and are seen to be advancing the Taiwan separatism cause. I'm not making judgement whether Taiwan should or should not be separate, but HK's value to Beijing is to demonstrate that one country two system could work. And now they want help from their Colonial overlords, and forgetting that they have no value to the British. It's 7 million people on a tiny speck on this earth. It's not like the Brits have a base, or the GCHQ is in Tamar. What could the Hong Kongers offer to the British that would make them do anything more than pay the occasional lip service? This is aside from the fact that they themselves are mired in Brexit, which if that goes through, they're likely to face calls of separation from the Scots and reunification for Ireland. It may not even be wise for them to be seen to support separatism causes at this point in time.The only thing that hong kong has to offer is the developed and modern port facilities but the Chinese desperately want control of them for both economic and military reasons so its probably in britian's best interest to not piss off china now",-7

On a continent that's not so fond of immigration, especially from our southern and south-eastern neighbors, their welcoming attitude is rather unique: despite being only 2% of EU population, they take in 20% of migrants. They're also very, very strict on political correctness. It's hard to have a political conversation with a Swede without being offensive.

uid_174051,"My Best Friend Practically Said He Wanted to Rape Me. I have two friends in this story. Lets call them Sarah and William. Sarah and I have been friends for years. She is a lovely person and I trust her completely. William and I have been friends for several years. He was my closest male friend and I have shared a lot of life events with him, good and bad. William's sister is getting married at the end of this summer. He invited me to be his plus one to the wedding. His sister is Jewish and her finance is Indian so they are having two weddings which were going to be this big week long affair. Since the wedding festivities were going to be lasting so long naturally people will be staying in a hotel near-by (paid for by the bride and groom). Since I was going to be William's plus one we'd be sharing a hotel room, something I was 100% comfortable with. Well, several weeks ago my friend Sarah texts me saying, ""Don't go to the wedding with William."" I ask her why not since I was very much looking forward to going. To that she replies, ""William says he hopes to get you really drunk at the wedding and then have sex with you."" I was completely outraged. To be honest I lost my mind for a little bit. William knows I have been raped in the past and he knows how I feel about these types of things. He was fully aware of what he was saying and what he was implying. I called William and told him what Sarah said. He didn't deny saying it. I told him why what he said was in no way acceptable. Then I started to get a little hysterical with yelling, crying, and anger. During this whole time he never denied saying what Sarah said he said, he never said he didn't mean it the way it sounded, he never even said he was sorry. Then I hung up. That was the last time I spoke to him. I don't answer his calls or texts and I no longer have an interest in being his friend. It tore me up, still tears me up, that someone I considered a friend would want to do that to me. Especially since he knows my background with the type of thing. I still think about it and it just wreaks me. It makes me even more fearful of making new male friends. I know not all men are evil, terrible people, but I considered this guy to be one of my very best friends and then I find something like this out. It hurts.Good riddance!",7

uid_63884,"Yes, social moderate. Perhaps I defined it myself. For example, I think gay people should be able to be legally recognized as together. But they should not be afforded the economic incentives (eg: tax benefits) of ""marriage"" because they cannot procreate, which is the primary reason the incentives were put there, to encourage procreation. Fully support HB2. Charlotte, and other cities, would've put into place legalized thrills for people who wanted to go into the opposite sex's bathroom. A few years ago no one would've thought about the idea but because ""identifying as X"" became well-known any frat kid, for example, could've used that new found knowledge to his advantage. I also respect the privacy expectations of individuals who aren't comfortable with trans folks being around them. I think it's insane to drastically overhaul life to make a minute fraction of a population ""feel"" better. HB2 did not affect private businesses whatsoever in terms of the bathroom. In fact, it called for public agencies to accommodate trans folks and encouraged them to build neutral facilities if needed. More on HB2, I am vehemently against the government threatening funding to manipulate state decisions. In terms of employment/wage laws that the bill covered it standardized these across the state. What if Charlotte decides $30 is the minimum wage? The economic effects would affect the state dramatically. Yes, I am very pro-life. I firmly believe there is no logical way to conclude pro-choice is acceptable and moral unless in the cases of rape, incest, or if the child were to be born with handicaps. Teachers in NC are paid, when adjusted for cost of living, the same as the vast majority of states. I do not think teachers should see an increase in salaries to $50,000 (this is Republican leadership raising teacher salaries after NC Democrats cut them). There is a huge supply of teachers, they work nine months of the year, ""good teachers"" get paid the same as ""bad teachers"" (how do you even measure that?), tenure exists, etc. And your comment about ""well regulated"" demonstrates your complete lack of legal and Constitutional knowledge of the Second Amendment including what ""well-regulated"" meant.We got a live one here!",10

uid_526436,"Supercell knows what they are doing with balancing If we look at the metas of the past in this game, we have had a lot of dominant metas. Including the hog rider freeze, mass defending buildings, royal giant, goison and maybe more. With the last patches supercell was able to create a more diverse meta. I can't think of any deck that is much scarier than any other decks right now. There is the lava hound, giant, hog rider, royal giant, cycle, golem, mortar, xbow and many more decks that are used a lot where I am currently in the ladder (around 4k). To add to this, I see many decks with legendaries and WITHOUT legendaries. I find its important that the legendaries should be good, but not necessary. They nerfed the zap spell so it would be less used but it is still used quite a lot. They are nerfing the ice spirit similarly to what they did to zap so that it becomes less used, but i believe it will change as much as the zap usage did when they nerfed it. They did that because these cards were/are overused. Unfortunately it is hard to balance such low cost cards that freeze troops. Although they weren't able to take zap out of the meta and probably won't take ice spirit out, they were able to make elixir collector a non necessary card in every deck (it must have been used more than 80% of the time and now it probably has less than 20%). Even if some people weren't really happy with the elixir collector change, it gives us a more healthy meta. Not only that, but a bit before they nerfed the poison to not slow anymore, they added the slowing effect to buildings for poison. When they did that no one thought it would make poison the best spell in the game. But they made a little error and then they fixed it. This post was really to remind people that supercell did an amazing job in balancing in the last patches. Even though they made a few errors previously, they respond by fixing those errors in later patches. Props to supercell for the amazing balance changed they previously did and for the upcoming one too.yeah man the princess nerf proved it all",-1

Think about it, if you're atheist and I say Merry Christmas you say thanks or something, or you explain to me how there is no God and you also stopped eating meat and joined crossfit. But you don't naturally respond with ""happy holidays"". What does that even mean? That there are more than one holiday to celebrate at this time of year. Well "" Happy Holidays"" started before Kwanzaa was even conceived, so it wasn't Kwanzaa's fault. It isn't anything Muslim. It's because of Hannaka. Chanukah is hard to spell and with more than one holiday these signs were getting expensive. Marketers decidedninstead of having a hanakuh sign and a Christmas sign and trying to decide the Jewish calendar theynciukd just say happy holidays and everyone would be happy. Even the atheists because in the US a day off work is rare enough thst hopefully they won't ruin that for everyone else. Plus you can keep the sign up until new years if you really want to. Also, it was Christian's friends, the Jews, who made it personal. They knew and cared for Jews and didn't want them to be left out of all the fun of Christmas. Baptists will tell you that they should have been evangelizing and converting souls, not trying to be inclusive on a superficial red cup level, but that's hard work converting the Jews. So instead people just changed the signs. And now all of an sudden it's supposed to be this atheist led SJW war against Christians? It was always about capitalism, not being as hardcore as Baptists, the price of sign lettering, the confusing spelling of chanukahh and not running in how awesome Christmas is to our friends (and bosses). There's not a war against Christmas. There has never been a war against Christmas. If you want to be outraged Christmas from a Christian perspective the target isn't ""happy holidays"" but rather the entire fucking fiasco of the commercialization of the event. From black Friday to Santa Clause, the whole damn thing. Have a Christmas with no tree and no presents and just pray about stuff and don't shop and don't stress and don't astch any tc for three months so Christmas hymns won't have the lyrics changed to sell cars and see if when you are close to God again and far from Macy's if ""happy holidays"" still offends you.

The boys can't be more than 8, and like most kids, they like to play in the back yard. Which is totally fine, doesn't bother me at all. They're kids and like to run around. What bothers me though is that they love to throw their toys over into my yard. Alot of toys. Action figures, balls, frisbees, rackets, etc. Them throwing them over don't even really bother me that much. What bothers me is that the parents keep demanding that we have to throw them back. They don't ask, they don't knock on the door and apologize, they just yell over there fence when they know that we are outside and TELL us to give it back. And that bothers me. They also seem to encourage their kids to throw it over to our yard. So after Christmas I was at the store and saw that they had a ton of Barbie's, nail polish, Bratz doll frisbees, and balls on the clearance. I bought 5 of everything I could find that I knew my neighbors would hate seeing their sons play with. Every time an action figure gets thrown over to my yard, I will throw a barbie back with it.

uid_852963,"I just want to read the next book. I remember being so excited about this series, about this story. It consumed me for years. I was just a naive summer child then, all those years ago when I only had to wait 6 months after discovering A Game of Thrones with that Robert Jordan blurb on the cover. Just six months for the third book in the series to be released. So long ago. Ages ago. In that time I entered and graduated college. I met a woman, fell in love, got married, and had kids. I watched in disbelieving fascination as HBO first picked up the rights, then greenlit the pilot, then pushed the story to series. I have spent almost half of my life waiting for the next installment and then the next installment and then the next installment. I have been introduced to and completed whole other fantasy series in that time. I even watched the Wheel of Time series - one I never thought would ever end - end. All while waiting for the next A Song of Ice and Fire book. I'm so sick and tired of waiting. My passion for this series, which was once red hot, is not smoldering and dying out. I have become so jaded that I truly believe we will see the end of the series on HBO before we will probably get even the next book and when that book is eventually released it will come with the news that Martin will need to write two or three more books which, frankly, I don't see as possible. A book series that I cherished more than most of my siblings, a book series that helped shaped the man I am today, a book series that had more influence on my life than 95% of my teachers and professors, and these days I feel little but disappointment from it. This is what parents must feel like when their children grow up to become criminals or high school dropouts or just total ineffective losers. And I fucking hate it.*This* is why GRRM doesn't read forums anymore, and I totally agree with you.",42

Few more years still and it's gauche in New York, mainstream in pop culture, and, still, the recalcitrant flyovers resist angrily. Finally, the children who grew up in flyover land seeing that trend on the VHS tapes are immunized and end up kind of falling in line with pop culture from 30 years ago, largely because by then their parents are too old and too weak from years of Culvers and Leinenkugel's to stop them. And in the meantime, that trend is also no longer gauche in New York because the oldsters have keeled over from AIDS, and the youngsters don't remember how gauche it once was. Right now we see midwesterners angrily denouncing the newfangled ""carl the cuck hipster nu-male glasses"" while gripping their wireframe glasses from Tom Cruise Mission Impossible as though it were just as important as their guns and bibles. And in the meantime youngsters from the coasts are embracing wireframe glasses as the next big thing.

I think for a guy, having a good sense of humor and being confidence but not being cocky will get you far, but if a you aren't physically attracted to someone, it's unlikely you'd agree to a date. If a girl that you just weren't attracted to for whatever reason asked you out on a date, what would you do? It's a hard truth, but if you're regularly being rejected by women you ask out, you might be batting out of your league.How the shit is a man supposed to get practice at date activities unless he finds someone to take to practice with?",6

uid_425079,"PAID OFF -- Student Loans starting balance of $57,000.00 paid off in under three years I was very lucky to graduate from undergrad without any student loan or personal debt. My degree, political science, was not very lucrative and I had always wanted to go to law school. I then received a 1/2 scholarship to a mediocre law school and eventually received additional merit scholarships, making my 3L year free. I lived at home throughout the duration of law school to save costs, accruing $57,000.00 in loans. I graduated in 2011, the bottom of the worst legal job market in history. I graduated without a job (1400 people applied for 40 spots with my county District Attorney). I worked part time (i.e., 4-6 days a month) as an appearance attorney, making only enough money to cover the payments on the 25 extended payment plan (i.e., essentially interest only). I finally found full time work at the end of 2012, with a firm that would pay me to train and learn the law, salary of $60,000.00 for 3.5 months. That firm let me go, but in the interim I built up some savings. I was then unemployed for six weeks, but had 3.5 months experience under my belt competing with applicants of 3-5 years experience. I then found a job through a recruiter with a smaller firm, but still at $60k / yr. After nine months into my position with firm #2, they bumped me to $100,000.00 per year and I am now just over a year with them. Throughout the duration of my unemployment/underemployment/employment, I have been lucky to live at home with my folks. All my excess money has gone to service the loans and I just recently cut a check for the final $15,000.00 total payment. Now, the next step is to build my savings, fund my retirement (which I have done each of the years I was getting a paycheck), and get away from the parentals' house. I have been incredibly lucky to find a lucrative job (that I like a little bit) and to have parents letting me ride rent free for a bit, but goddamn, does it feel good to be done with the loan payments.If I made $100k a year I would also be able to pay of my debts in a few short years, or actually months.",-1

uid_996282,"My opinion and critique of FACEIT-NA Open League. I'm a rather new Dota player compared to most, and I only discovered the league scene a year ago. At that time, IXDL-O was the leading open league and NEL was the leading invitational league. While at times it was a struggle to play one game (dead league) in a day there were other times where the league was quite populated. Eventually I earned an invite to NEL through the open league (though my skill was close to the bottom of the league) and played in that for a couple of months. In May, ixmike88 closed both IXDL-O and NEL and 'moved' the leagues to FACEIT and FPL. While FPL has been a success, attracting more skilled players than NEL and achieving a new level of exclusivity, FACEIT open league has many flaws which did not exist in IXDL-O and need to be mended. So with that let me examine and present some of the thoughts which come to my mind about the league. * No IRC chat. One of the main features of the IXDL client was IRC. FACEIT doesn't have an IRC chat, instead having a clunky chat for both out-of-game discussion and pre-game discussion, requiring closing the chat and reopening it to update it. In addition, nobody even uses it. Despite there being 6 games and more players in queue right now, the last chat message posted was one hour ago and before that seven hours. Part of league play is to be more than just gamefinding, it's to build up a strong playerbase who have the potential to form teams who will drive competition in the future. If there's no easy way for players to socialize things are just the same as if it were normal ranked queuing. * No forums. Not only is there no easy chat for communication between players and staff, there's no forums! How this could possibly be seen as a good design decision is beyond me. There's no easy way to voice complaints or further expansion of a community. * No apparent moderation. I have never seen a mod. Nobody is watching games. Replays are inaccessible, players who intentionally throw games (not even starting with people whose skill level is so low that they should still be playing vs bots) are left unpunished. IXDL-O and NEL had visible, active, and effective moderation. Players who threw games were warned, players who disobeyed captain were warned. Being captain doesn't mean anything when your 2k player gets to take a hero from your 5k player which ends up costing the game. There is no way to prevent players like this losing games. It shows that there's no leadership from the staff of FACEIT and it's especially a problem because it makes the moderation just as disconnected from the users as in regular matchmaking, except in regular matchmaking you at least get a message when someone you reported had action taken against them. * Matchmaking is incredibly flawed. Teams stacked with two diamonds and a master against a team with one gold player and four unranked are common in my games. While I don't have access to every game to see how things are nor are there any accessible winrate stats, I would wager that Radiant wins at least 70% of their games. Not because of the inherent Radiant advantages in the game, but because the matchmaking is faulty and stacks players on Radiant. However, I have no evidence to back this point up so it remains a simple observation as a player that I feel is true. Because of all of these reasons, FACEIT remains only slightly superior to matchmaking instead of being miles ahead of it. If FACEIT wants to improve as an organization and a league it needs to make major changes, especially to the overall platform, which is antithetical to the very ideas of league play. The games I've played have been mostly one sided stomps while solid games are few and far between. It's completely a step down from IXDL-O and needs major rethinking.The only constant in your games is you.",-2

uid_548500,"Waiters/waitresses are overpaid I already know you will all hate me and disagree. I am a chef so I have worked my way up in the industry to get where I am and have a deep understanding of the waiter waitress position in restaurants. This is not coming from ignorance or jealousy its from sheer observation and first hand experience. Waiters and waitresses are over paid. There is no reason that any unskilled worker should make that much money. Many cooks I've worked with have started at 10$ an hour and every hour they get pelted with order after order literally running around trying to keep up, sweat on their brows working long shifts and due to the shortage of cooks in the US often picking up more shifts than they even want. Often being over worked to the point where they barely get one day off. waking up, going to work all day and night with no breaks only to be able to quickly scarf something down to get enough energy for the dinner rush that will definitely bury them. I'm not gonna shit all over you guys and detail every instance where most waitresses and waiters are lazy because when you all look at the line you know who the real workers of the restaurant are. The people who are highly skilled and trained to understand the food making processes to ensure a safe and delicious meal for all customers. These guys often have worked for years to get where they are performing dubious and dangerous tasks to create wonderful works of art only to make less money than the people who's job is to be fake happy to the customers and walk your creations out and scrape the plates (which often times they can't even do properly or even be courteous and stack plates for the poor dishwashers.) I was working this summer, I took over as the chef, for no raise I was worked 86 hours a week for 12$ an hour that meant 6 days a week I woke up and worked with no breaks until the time I slept. I was making roughly 900-1000$ a week only to have a waiter (my friend) come in front of my line and announce how his slowest week this summer he made 700$ BY ONLY WORKING 20 HOURS A WEEK!!!!! this wage gap is too far there is no reason that waiters should make that much. A local business owner recently went tip free which I applaud but now the local waiters and waitresses are taking to all of the review websites and posting nasty reviews trying to get them shut down because they don't want other local businesses to follow suit. It's really sad that these unskilled and lazy workers are paid so highly when the truly skilled workers in the industry get the shaft. Alright you've read my rant I now want to hear your opinions.I've always thought cooks were underpaid.",3

T: 12:44 simple actions have become difficult, slight vegetative state, spent too long lying on my bed staring at the shadows on the ceiling that seemed to change into new images, such as a deer, an indian man, and frank from Donnie Darko. Stuart has a piece of my hair, apparently it's amazing, he looses it, i give him several more pieces of hair. He said he couldn't fathom in his mind that the more hair he had, the more stuff that would happen. Decide to eat an ice lollie. T: 1:00 Flat mate is tripping balls, he can't stop laughing, he looks like an old Chinese lady in the corner of my eye. He decides he wants to eat some grapes so he washes them in the sink, he takes the packaging off and drips of water start falling from the packaging, he panics thinking he is dropping loads of tiny grapes everywhere. I'm moving my hands around, i can see my hands several frames behind, like i'm seeing where my hands were literally milliseconds before as well as seeing them where they were now. Decide to eat an ice lollie. T: 1:45 decide to go out for another cigarette, not because i feel the need to smoke, but because i want to go on an adventure, decided to wear my dressing gown, because that way i definitely have to come back??? Feel anxious leaving the music and the lamp that makes the pretty shadows behind, Stuart (Flatmate) tells me it's ok, we don't need it because he's wearing his sunglasses??? Alois asks if we have keys to get back in, i tell him yes, he tells me he doesn't believe in the existence of my keys, forgets, brings grapes with him. T: 2:00 Alois is in his room in the dam listening to sweet valley, he said he can feel the music like and electric plus travelling through his head. Me and Stuart Have sex. Hands own best sex of my life, like fuck, i could feel every inch of him surrounding me, it felt primal and incredible. I mean, if any one saw it, it was come very vanilla sex, like, straight up missionary for like forty minutes, but it felt amazing, and i didn't want to not be able to see his face, it felt so close and safe. didn't cum, didn't care. Decide to get up and eat an Ice lollie. T 3:00 decided to find Alois. find him in his room in the dark, lay and talk about life, the meaning of it, and how everything seems so simple on acid, like i revert back to a stage of child like wonder, everything is new and amazing, i want to be on acid forever. T: 4:00 decided to eat and Ice lollie. Convince Alois to eat a scotch bonnet pepper, he does. decided to make food, have a really satisfying time chopping a tomato, like too satisfying, like really satisfying. get out a bell pepper, take a bite, crunch sounds amazing, everyone wants to crunch the pepper. sit at table passing round a pepper for half an hour, forget to cook food. Eat an Ice lollie. T: 5:00 go back to my room, we watch some Cyriak videos, listen to some suicide sheep mixes and some more sweet valley whilst watching the shows dance around, we talk about life some more, about epiphanies we have had whilst on acid, i never want to not be on acid. T:7:00 Finally coming down, shadows are slowing, i'm getting sleepy, i can tell i'm coming down, because i'm starting to worry about really stupid everyday stuff, like that thing i said the other week and whether people i don't like think i'm a nice person. sleep it off. since then i have been generally quite down, on acid is the happiest i have ever been and i don't want to go back to life not on acid, real life terrifies me, and i don't see the point in it if you're just spending your whole life just trying not to be unhappy. TL;DR : Ate a whole pack of 18 twister lollies.Glad you had a good time, I can't wait to do some good ol' LSD again.",4

I was playing around with movement speed quints and a movement speed build on Fiora and still could not effectively proc enemy's vitals unless they were directly facing her. She is just not mobile enough to even reach the back of an opponent. This reminds me of how random Quinn's passive is. You have to wait for it to randomly appear and it removes all element of agency from the player. Her ult heal is definitely going to help in a duo lane and a support will be the thing she needs to actually engage upon an enemy and hit their vitals all while getting back into the farming stance safely. There is just no plausible way she can skirmish in a 1v1 setting and come out on top. This all comes down to the simple fact that she is just not fast enough to proc vitals that end up on awkward sides of the opponent.Her q and e slow totally make the vitals hard to hit,0

I was watching the documentary ""Prophets Prey"" which describes life in the polygamist communities of Texas and Short Creek that are under the control of the FLDS Church in Warren Jeffs. One sociological flaw that I never seriously considered, but seems so obvious, is the ratio of men to women. In order for FLDS leaders to take multiple wives, a good chunk of the men have to be kicked out of the community (since a small select group of men are hoarding all the women). Let's suppose for a minute that Joseph Smith truly was a prophet and inspired by God to reveal the celestial order of marriage, which is plural marriage. If that were true, then the **majority of men will have no place** in the celestial kingdom and will not even be permitted to have a female companion for all eternity, as they will be hoarded by a select group of men. The ratios are much more dire then you'd expect, but again are really quite obvious mathematically. Let's say the average man has five wives. That would mean **80% of all men would have no place in heaven**. That's worse than the 1/3 that were supposedly kicked out before earth life. Yes the ratios are closer to what Joseph Smith and Brigham Young followed, only one in 48 men have a shot a heaven. That means 98 percent have their wife taken away (like property) and reassigned to a man who only sleeps with her once every six weeks. If life in America has taught you anything, it's not your odds of ending up in the 1% are pretty low. Like a 1 and 100 shot. So the odds are pretty good that your wife is going to be taken away and reassigned to some dirtbag apostle or something. Tl;dr The Celestial Kingdom as revealed and Doctrine and Covenants 132 simply does not work, now, or in the life to come. It benefits a tiny group of men at the expense of all women and most men.Women are naturally more spiritual than men so they were never going to make it anyway!",1

Most of the conversation had consisted of: ""Just turn on a TV! It's on every channel!"" The whole airport had been shut down, the goddamn ladies' room had been cordoned off, and at this point estimates were that there were no less than fifty-three people in there, Linda included. At one point they'd taken the door off the hinges and sent people in as a human chain. Just watching it, just looking in from a distance had been nauseating, the white tile warping subtly and curving and seeming to go on forever. Someone's grip had slipped, and another nine people lost to the ladies' room. The survivors had told horror stories about blood and other bodily fluids, toilets clogged and overflowing. They'd eventually had to put the door back up. The plan now was to just blow open a wall on the side of the ladies' room, make it so that it wasn't a room anymore. Current scuttlebutt was about what would happen to the people who were still inside. There was a lot of talk about shaped charges, controlled demolition, words that made my head spin. I was on my knees, praying, when there was a sudden rush of air out of the room, like everyone taking a breath. The door swung open and Linda stepped out, primping her hair, as fine as the moment she'd walked in. Twenty four hours living in an airport had turned me into a goddamn mess. The crowd burst into cheers, rushing around her, two officers ushering her away from the door as she looked around in shock. I was pushing up-current through the crowd, screaming, ""It's me! Linda, it's me! That's my wife! Oh my god, that's my wife!"" There were hands on the both of us pushing us forwards, and then she was in my arms again and everyone else mercifully backed away. ""Linda!"" I said, and collapsed on my knees, dragging my head down to her waist. ""Oh my god, Linda, I thought I lost you, you were in there for hours, hours, over a day!"" Her pretty little eyes blinked and she stared down at me. ""I - A day? Really? I mean, I knew it was a long time, but I didn't think -"" ""I'm just so glad you're safe,"" I said, and pulled myself up to my feet, kissing her straight on the lips. ""What the hell happened in there, Linda? What were you doing in there all this time?"" ""Well,"" she said, and frowned slightly and extricated herself from my arms. ""I don't think it's all that strange, Harry. Do you know how crowded it was in there?""the story is really well-written, but the thing with the human chain and the blood on the wall just doesn't fit with the end...",3

uid_536886,"Yu-Gi-Oh GX Respect Thread Yugioh GX was both a great manga and a great Anime but it does get a lot of flack. I understand that we were right off the heels of the Yugi vs Yami Duel. A great duel to end a great series and then to many peoples surprise we went to something...happier, lighter than what we were used to. And to many that was a turn off. Yugioh DM started off with the Shadow Games, right off the back souls were taken, Cards were ripped and peoples sight was on the line. But Yugioh GX started off with more of a slice of life, being more comedic and friendly. And the 4Kids Dub made it even more of a comedy. This caused a lot of people to stop watching, and thus miss an entirely great series. The first season was different, but had a lot to offer. From the birth of Manjoume Thunder, to the great Duels that Ryou had. Season 1 is admittedly the weakest out of the four. Season 2 is where things really pick up. Ryou loses and turns into Hell Kaiser, Judai loses and gains the NeoSpacians, Aster Phoenix is introduced, a Zero Turn Kill happens, We get to see Old Man Mutou and Kaiba again and Manjoume is the one who wins the tournament. On top of all of this we also get to see a Naked Bastion, A God Card and we get to see the Villain refuse to Duel. Saou gets the key he needs for the satellite looks over to Judai and essentially says 'Why would I duel you?' Now in come Season 3. We start off with the arrival of five new duelists, each of them supposed to be the best of their schools. We get great duels with each of the New Comers. We get to see another dimension where essentially a Yugioh verson of the Zombie Apocalypse happens. We are introduced to one of the best villains in Anime (Yubel). Then we go to another dimension. Characters die, so many characters die. But what is so great about this, is Judai is the one to do this. He rushed in and got his friends killed, he turned to darkness and killed more of his friends. Aster battles Exodia, Kaiser gets an extremely good duel against Yubel. Adrian falls to Yubel too. Then Judai and Yubel fuse. Finally we arrive at the final season. Judai has matured in not only mind but looks too. His dueling style changes from having fun, to winning as quick as possible, but we also learn that he is dealing with depression. We see other characters cap off their character arcs. Manjoume beating Aster, Sho becoming a Cyber Duelist, Asuka going to become a teacher. Atticus having a great duel where he actually beats Fujiwara but time stuff happens. On top of all that we get to see Judai face Yugi and Yami. To put it plainly, GX has some of the best duels in the series. Most of those great duels come from Season 3 and Season 4. The series has the best character development and even develops the side characters, making them never static but ever changing to the environment around them. The villains past season 1 were great and I think Yubel is probably one of the best villains in the series. Her motivation wasn't to conquer or destroy but to express her love to Judai. Her plan was the most destructive and she had some of the best duels. Yubel also had a good win rate and buildup. This is something that Yugioh usually lacks in their villains, they usually have only one duel where they lose to the main character. GX had a satisfying ending that tied up most of the characters, which is a plus compared to most animes now a days. It's a shame to see GX trashed on, because it is legitamently a great show that people should give a chance.Just ignore 4Kids, and GX (and hell, even 5Ds) is right up there with the original series.",0

Socialism in the 20th century seems dominated by the Industry focused Marxism.

It feels like I'm being some kind of horrible killjoy and ruining the good time. But I *only* have that reaction to safewords, not to just saying ""no"" or ""no more of that"" or ""my hand is going numb"", or ""I can only take a little more of this"" or ""this one fucking spot on my thigh is a zillion times more sensitive now than anywhere else and if you're gonna hit it, make sure it's on purpose"". Those are all absolutely fine, but I just have the weirdest psychological reaction to red and yellow. Since I don't do con-non-con ever, it's worked fine. There've been situations before I realized this about myself, where I've tried to just sit through situations that upset me. They weren't enough to make me totally freak out then and there, and I just really didn't want to ruin everyone else's fun with even yellowing out of that particular activity, even if the scene continued, which... it probably should not have. Whereas if I'd just felt like it was an option to say ""wait, I'm having a weird emotion, can we stop while I figure it out"", then I could have done that and been absolutely fine. That is just what I do now. It helps that there is literally no state of mind in which I *cannot* talk.

Now, I'm very busy in college: I'm double-majoring in physics and electrical engineering, trying to keep up a 3.75 GPA so I can go to graduate school, my GREs are looming over me like some malevolent beast, I'm taking 19 credits and holding not one but two jobs, I'm involved in sports, I'm the president of the Society of Physics Students chapter on campus and involved heavily in another (math team). It's not that I have no interest in dating, I've said repeatedly that if I met someone who I thought was really interesting I'd make time, but unless she's hiding in a textbook or a computer lab I'm probably not going to be meeting her for the time being. Anyway. They then told me that if I don't ""develop those skills"", I won't find someone ""before it's too late"". Ignoring the blatant intrusion into my personal life, I asked ""Too late for what?"" (knowing the answer, of course) to which they told me that if I married ""too late"" we wouldn't have enough time for children. To which I said, no problem, I don't ever plan on having any. And then they flipped out. The first thing they said (and this is where I got mad) was that I need to stop being such an ""overachieving perfectionist"", because it's caused me to place my ambitions above ""family"", and causing me to become ""noncommittal to what's really important."" A little interlude. Understand that there are parents the world over who would literally kill for their offspring to be accomplishing what I am now. And they're going to complain that I'm too hard-working? So, really? Noncommittal? Two jobs: tutoring and TA'ing. Research. 19 credits. Engineering and physics. Grad school ambitions. President of a chapter of an academic society. Math team. Sports. Student orchestra. And I'm fucking noncommittal? Just blow me. I have never in my entire life felt so disrespected. I said that that's what's important to me. One day, my family would only be as a couple (and I'm skeptical of marriage too, since in my mind it's a sexist cultural anachronism from a time when women were property, but that's another rant for another day), and that's it. I have no interest in children. Period. Then I got the ""But having a *real* family is part of the human experience!"" Well, first of all, I actually philosophically identify with the transhumanist movement, so I frankly don't care what anyone else says about the ""human experience"", of course I didn't say this so it's neither here nor there. I'll decide for myself what my ""human experience"" will be, thank you. And also, I find it deeply troubling that you say that people without children are not ""real families"". Followed by some assorted ""selfish"" garbage and defaulting to me apparently having been damaged by working too hard in college, at which point they actually seriously threatened to stop paying for me to go to college! Now, ordinarily, that statement would horrify and infuriate me. But in this instance all I could do was laugh. I've consistently maintained a full-ride scholarship as a result of my ""unhealthy perfectionism"". On top of that, legally, the college fund belongs to me anyway and they agreed (by form of a binding contract) that it will fully disburse to me when I graduate so it's not like there's anything they could do even if I didn't have a scholarship. Then a minute of awkward silence on their part and some grumbling about selfishness, ultimately grudgingly telling me they ""respect"" my decision (as if). The important thing is that I won. tl;dr: Parents bingoed me and complain that I'm a perfectionist for not wanting children, get soundly shut down when they started being nasty.Would have been tempted to take a crap in the middle of their living room and tell them to enjoy the ""Human Experience"" while walking out the door.",4

uid_423139,"An average player's first impressions on Tracer Disclaimer: says so right in the title but to make it clear I'm not a pro player and probably not even a ""good"" player. These are my opinions and they are also very early impressions, based mostly on the AI games I played yesterday to try my hand with her. Do comment or debate what I'm saying because that's the point of this post. With that out of the way, a few random thoughts about Tracer: * Boy she's squishy. The pure hp numbers don't translate well into actual combat. Sure, Li Ming has less hp, and Valla/Nova have pretty much the same amount, however they also have the range advantage and are not *forced* by their kits to get into melee range. You'll take a lot of damage even while being careful, your B key will fade from usage. * Playing tracer against AI poses some particular challenges and opportunities, something that will be less pronounced against players (except perhaps very good or very bad ones). First thing is: the AI AA game is top notch. If there are no other nearby heroes, the AI will start AAing you the millisecond you get in range. It's uncanny and also quite deadly for tracer. On the other hand, if you find a bot in ""run"" mode, it's easier than killing a minion as they won't fight you at all, even if they could kill you. And they certainly can't outrun you. * While fun to play, I get the impression she'll be mostly a niche hero in pro play, as there are very few things she does well, while easily becoming a liability if not in very expert hands. * Playing without support is annoying as hell, you'll be hearthing a lot. On the other hand, playing with support (Tassadar in particular) is another matter entirely. That said, a look at the talent choices. **Level 1** At level one I feel that Slipstream is going to be the sensible choice most of the time. Not only the reduced cooldown is nice, but the added second of recall is, I found, crucial. Apparently 3 seconds will put you in harms way, while 4 seconds will leave you in a safe place. Unless you plan on using recall only to dash in, combo, recall out, you should really take this talent. Tracer rounds may have uses in some geometry heavy maps, if it keeps the enemy visible through fog of war. In that case it will help you run down enemy heroes. Pulse Strike seems really underwhelming, with a caveat I'll discuss later at tier 13. **Level 4** This is a tricky level... Is that a health pack will feel needed the first few times you play her. You take so much damage and have so little health that the healing boost seems worthy. While the talent makes the fountains heal you to full, the effect on the globes is frankly barely noticeable. This talent also scales terribly in late game, when you won't be able to use the fountain much and globes won't be as readily as available as before. Untouchable is clear in function however it requires a dedication and skill to pull of for such a limited buff that it seems to me it's going to be extremely difficult to pull off. You simply die too easily and the bonus is only to AA damage (which means your burst potential doesn't actually go up much). Also 15 takedowns is a lot... Now, if it was permanent or permanent after completion it could be worth it... Or maybe a 5% buff per takedown, requiring only 6 takedowns to max, meaning you could still get use out of it even while dying a bit. Parting gift... Well, on paper the damage is nice and could contribute to the burst, however the mechanics of the bomb should be clarified... They don't seem to aim for targets, rather are spread around in a fairly large range, meaning they can be very unreliable. More experiments will need to be done about this. **Level 7** All three options seem somewhat decent. However, having tried a mix of all of them, my guess is Jumper is going to be better on average. Mostly because it gives you more burst and it's more difficult to run out of. Bullet time requires costant use to get a reduction of under 30%. You get faster recovery from a burst, but only if you can constantly AA something. Spatial echo may be situationally useful but Jumper still seems more reliable even in the situations where Spatial echo may be useful. **Level 10** This tier is interesting because unlike other heroes, I have the impression that all three choices are good, in the right situation. Pulse Rounds is probably the ""jack of all trades"". The added range is great for practicing and for hitting enemies that are getting close to their defenses without exposing yourself. The faster charge rate also means that you get to fire the ultimate more often, which is always nice. Quantum spike could see use against some health heavy enemy composition (say, double warrior, azmodans and stuff like that). Unlike the early info, it doesn't seem like it becomes single target anymore, which is great. Also, one interaction that would be nice to test, is how it works against AI targets. In particular, since it doesn't specify ""target hero"" but rather a generic ""primary target"", would sticking it to a target like a punisher/web weaver/garden terror/boss allow it to do a crapload of damage? If that's the case then it could be worth using in the relevant maps. Sticky Bomb usefulness is clear, and definitely best suited against a melee heavy team or in a composition that makes the best out of stacked AoEs (like, moshpit, maw, grav bomb, etc). Could also be situationally useful against runners but in general you don't have trouble keeping up with them. However it may be useful as a sort of peel, when combined with the lvl 20 KB talent. **Level 13** With all discussions about Ricochet, I believe it's not the talent to pick here. And as much as she feels squishy and any bit of healing would help, leeching rounds is not the talent to pick here either (though it could be a bit more arguable if it leeched against any target rather than just heroes). No, the talent to pick here is Bullet Spray. For several reasons: 1) Even though it's late, it gives Tracer the wave clear she sorely lacks for most of the game. Not as important as it would have been before, it's still impactful enough to be worth mentioning. 2) The added burst in teamfights is huge. Melee hits *hard*. The added range also means it's a ^tiny bit less risky to use. 3) This should be tested, as I didn't pay notice BUT: melee wording is ambiguous ""Gain 5% Pulse Bomb charge when damaging an enemy, and 10% against Heroes."". What happens if you hit more than one target? Do you get charge for each? I suspect not, however if you do it's easy to see why this would be an even better talent than it already is. Which brings me back to tier 1... If the charge works indeed like this, the added charge against heroes from the tier 1 talent means that hitting with just one melee 3 heroes (not that difficult unless they are all ranged) would charge your ultimate by 45% rather than 30%. **However** this *must* be tested as atm it's only a wet dream. **Level 16** The second most uninspired tier. Not much to say... If you can reliably hit the reload, go for Locked and Loaded (though I suspect in teamfights it's going to be more difficult). Focus fire is pretty much pointless against minions, though it does work against structures and large targets. It can work against heroes if it doesn't put you out of position (yeah you can move fast but they can delete you with a sneeze). Sleight of Hand is the safest (and smallest buff), though it may edge out focus fire in the long run. **Level 20** I'll say it. Total Recall is useless. It can save you in a pinch, don't get me wrong. But if you take enough damage in 3/4 seconds to make this talent worthwhile, you're probably dead before you can activate it, or you'll end up dead soon thereafter anyway. A small retreat followed by support heals (something you can do without this talent), is going to be almost always better, and you don't have to give up a lvl 20 talent for it. I'm a bit torn here, for a couple of reasons... Composition B is powerful, no doubt about that and regardless of the lvl 10 upgrade you took (though Sticky bombs is going to get the best out of it, due to the early slow and large range. Pulse spike may work if the second bomb gets the damage buff of the first, otherwise it's the worse option for composition B). However I feel Get Stuffed may be better. The reason is that melee does just slightly less damage than the AoE part of pulse bomb. With Get Stuffed you get a 60% boost in uptime for melee, which means more burst and more pulse bomb charge. In fact, if you can reliably melee on cooldown during teamfights, you can get more damage out of get stuffed than on composition B (which, should be pointed out, is also conditional on actually hitting a hero... Not extremely difficult but you *can* miss, or hit minions, or whatever). In the extreme case of having taken Pulse Strike, Bullet spray (and that the charge is per target hit) and Get Stuffed, you could: Run in with full bomb, use it, use melee, get some 45% charge, drop some autoattacks and 5 seconds later run in again, melee and drop a SECOND pulse bomb. That could be some amazing AoE burst potential. Still, even if you can't drop a second pulse bomb, the AoE melee strike will provide a significant chunk of damage regardless and also the additional benefit of the instant explosion + KB. That's pretty much it... In general I'd say tracer is fairly weak early game and will need support (though she can work well enough to assist early ganks), while she has the potential to be extremely impactful late game, provided you are able to stay alive for more than 3 seconds (harder than it seems).The average players opinion of fighting tracer: Holy fuck I've never faced such an annoying hero.",2

Just on the off, I'd like to say I've always used this subreddit for general motivation to improve my life, particularly socially and academically/professionally rather than with fitness. Today, I was thinking about picking up Call of Duty: Black Ops II while I was on my way into uni. Then I walked past the gym. Started a membership there instead. I've never really been unfit. I run 3 miles on the road just about every day. As long as I can remember though, I've been naturally skinny as hell. I plan on fixing that and putting a bit of muscle on. It was just a moment of clarity out of nowhere. I could buy the videogame, play it for an hour or two in the evenings and go through the same motions that I have with however many iterations of the series I've played over the years. Or, I could put that money towards something that's more productive and a new experience (I've never been part of a gym since leaving my secondary school, it was a sports college). Got my induction on Monday.

Fear not! The story will continue on my return if that is what folks would like to see. I do have some questions though and would like you to post your opinions. It has been suggested that I move into some form of video format instead of picture updates. I have registered a youtube channel and have been experimenting with capture software. I will figure it all out eventually. Should I change this campaign to videos? Should I start a new campaign with a similar world for videos and keep posting picture updates for this campaign? What would you like to see more of? More photos of base design and more incremental changes? Fighting parts only? Keep it the same? (About an even split base/map/battle.)
